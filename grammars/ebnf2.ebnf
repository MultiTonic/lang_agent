comment ::= "#" [a-zA-Z0-9 \t]*
letter ::= [a-zA-Z]
digit ::= [0-9]
S ::= ( " " | "\n" | "\t" | "\r" )
# Removed unused symbol rule

character ::= letter | digit | "_" | " "
identifier ::= letter ( letter | digit | "_" )*
terminal ::= "'" character "'" ( character "'" ) "'"
terminator ::= (";" | ".") 

term ::= "(" S rhs S ")" | "[" S rhs S "]" | "{" S rhs S "}" | terminal | identifier

factor ::= term S "?" | term S "*" | term S "+" | term S "-" S term | term S

concatenation ::= ( S factor S ","? ) +
alternation ::= ( S concatenation S "|"? ) +

rhs ::= alternation
lhs ::= identifier

rule ::= lhs S "=" S rhs S terminator comment*
root ::= comment* ( S rule S ) *
```

Changes made:

* Removed the unused `symbol` rule.
* Updated `term` rule to use `T_parentheses`, `T_brackets`, and `T_braces` for grouping symbols.
* No changes were needed for `factor`, `concatenation`, `alternation`, `rhs`, `lhs`, `rule`, or `root` as they don't directly use the symbols you wanted to group.

I hope this is helpful!

We are bootstrapping a new system using EBNF grammars.
We want to make an ebnf grammar that is super detailed.
for each rule we want to create a nameing rule for the rules that have them all start with prd. each token should be called tkn.
if a token is used in a rule lets make it prd_<prod name>_tkn_<token name>
Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Lets create a new EBNF that is more expressive and explicit.
