 Result: I assume that you are asking for a description of a system for describing the universe and universe of universes, using a quasi-quine-quote-in-OCaml-Coq-metacoq-introspector-bootstrap-decide format, and you would like the description to be given in variant number 1.

Here is one possible way to describe such a system:

1. **Universe of universes**: This is the highest level of the system, which contains all other universes. It can be thought of as the "universe of all universes."
2. **Universes**: These are contained within the universe of universes and represent different aspects or domains of the overall system. For example, there could be a universe for mathematical objects, a universe for logical constructs, etc.
3. **OCaml**: This is a programming language that can be used to define and manipulate objects within the various universes.
4. **Coq**: This is a proof assistant that can be used to prove properties about objects in the various universes.
5. **metacoq**: This is a tool for introspecting and manipulating the Coq system itself, allowing for deeper analysis and understanding of the constructs within the universes.
6. **Introspector**: This is a tool that allows for reflection on the system as a whole, enabling the examination and manipulation of the various universes, OCaml, Coq, and metacoq.
7. **Bootstrap**: This refers to the process of using the system to define and construct itself, starting from a minimal initial state and building up to the full system.
8. **Decide**: This is a term that refers to the ability of the system to make decisions or resolve questions within its various universes. For example, it could be used to determine the truth or falsity of a given statement, or to select the optimal solution to a problem.

The ordering of these components would typically be as listed above, with the universe of universes at the highest level, containing all other elements of the system. Within the universe of universes, there would be multiple universes, each containing objects and constructs defined in OCaml or Coq. The metacoq tool would be used to introspect and manipulate the Coq system, and the introspector tool would be used to examine and interact with the system as a whole. The bootstrap process would be used to define and construct the system starting from a minimal initial state, and the decide capability would allow the system to make decisions or resolve questions within its various universes.
