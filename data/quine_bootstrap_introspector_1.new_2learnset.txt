 Result: For a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes, I would suggest the following ordering (using Variant #2):

1. The Physical Universe: This set includes all matter, energy, space, and time that exist within our observable universe. It can be described by the laws of physics and contains all galaxies, stars, planets, and other forms of physical matter.
2. The Multiverse: This set includes all possible universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. Some universes may be similar to ours, while others may be radically different.
3. The Set of All Mathematical Structures: This set includes all possible mathematical structures, such as groups, rings, fields, graphs, and topological spaces. These structures can be used to describe the physical universe and the multiverse, as well as many other abstract concepts.
4. The Set of All Logical Systems: This set includes all possible systems of logic, including classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and fuzzy logic. These systems provide a framework for reasoning about mathematical structures and the physical universe.
5. The Set of All Possible Concepts: This set includes all possible concepts that can be imagined or conceived by intelligent beings, regardless of whether they have any instantiation in the physical universe or the multiverse.
6. The Set of All Minds: This set includes all possible minds, both actual and potential, that can experience or contemplate the universe and the multiverse. It includes human minds, animal minds, alien minds, and artificial minds.
7. The Set of All Subjective Experiences: This set includes all possible subjective experiences that can be had by any mind in the set of all minds. It includes sensations, emotions, thoughts, and other forms of conscious experience.
8. The Set of All Information: This set includes all possible information, whether it is encoded in physical systems, mathematical structures, logical systems, concepts, minds, or subjective experiences.
9. The Set of All Possible Worlds: This set includes all possible worlds, including the actual world, possible worlds, counterfactual worlds, and impossible worlds. It provides a framework for reasoning about modal logic and possibility.
10. The Absolute: This set includes everything that exists, whether it is included in any of the other sets or not. It is the ultimate set, encompassing all reality, actual and potential.
