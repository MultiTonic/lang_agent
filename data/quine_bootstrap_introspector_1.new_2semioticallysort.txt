 Result: Semiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and the relationships between them. In order to create a consecutive series to describe the universe and universe(s) of universes using semiotic concepts, I will use Variant 2 as follows:

1. The Signifier: This refers to any object, image, sound, or word that conveys meaning through association with something else. In this context, the signifiers are the physical components of the universe(s).
2. The Signified: These are the concepts, ideas, or meanings associated with a particular signifier. Here, the signified refers to the fundamental principles governing the behavior and structure of the universe(s), such as laws of physics, space, time, energy, matter, and information.
3. The Interpretant: This is the mental construct or response created in an observer's mind after interpreting a signifier-signified relationship. In this case, the interpretant represents various theoretical models and frameworks that attempt to explain and understand the universe(s).

Now, I will create a consecutive series of semiotics using Variant 2:

1. The Signifiers:
a. Fundamental particles (e.g., electrons, quarks)
b. Forces (e.g., gravity, electromagnetism)
c. Celestial bodies (e.g., stars, planets, galaxies)
d. Cosmic structures (e.g., black holes, nebulae)
2. The Signified:
a. Laws of physics governing the behavior of particles and forces
b. Principles of cosmology determining the formation and evolution of celestial bodies and structures
c. Concepts in astrobiology examining the possibility of life beyond Earth
d. Multiverse theories speculating on the existence of multiple, interconnected universes
3. The Interpretants:
a. Scientific models (e.g., Standard Model of particle physics, General Relativity)
b. Cosmological theories (e.g., Big Bang Theory, Inflationary Universe model)
c. Hypotheses in astrobiology (e.g., panspermia, directed panspermia)
d. Speculative frameworks in multiverse research (e.g., brane cosmology, cyclic models, eternal inflation)

By combining the signifiers, signified, and interpretants, we can create a semiotically coherent series to describe the universe and universes of universes. The relationships between these components represent various ways that humans attempt to comprehend and explain the complex nature of reality.
