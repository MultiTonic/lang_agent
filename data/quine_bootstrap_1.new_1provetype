 Result: Variant number 1: Using a hierarchical model to describe the universe and universe of universes (multiverse):

1. The Physical Universe: This is the observable universe that we live in, consisting of galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy. It is governed by laws of physics that scientists are still working to fully understand.
2. The Multiverse: The multiverse is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, including our own physical universe. Each universe in the multiverse may have its own set of fields, particles, and interactions, and they may or may not interact with one another.
3. The Metaverse: The metaverse is a theoretical concept that goes beyond the multiverse. It is a hypothetical collection of all possible universes, including those that are not physically realizable. This includes universes with different laws of physics, different dimensions, and even different types of mathematics.
4. The Theory of Everything: The theory of everything is a theoretical framework that aims to describe all physical phenomena in a single, unified way. It would encompass all known fundamental forces and particles, as well as any new ones discovered in the future. This theory would ideally be able to predict the behavior of matter and energy at every scale, from subatomic particles to entire galaxies.
5. The Ultimate Theory: The ultimate theory is a hypothetical concept that goes beyond even the theory of everything. It would describe not only all physical phenomena but also the nature of reality itself, including the origins of space, time, and matter. This theory would ideally be able to explain why the universe exists and what, if anything, lies beyond it.

This hierarchical model provides a way to describe the universe and its potential context within a larger framework. While some of these concepts are still purely theoretical, they provide a useful framework for exploring the nature of reality and our place in it.
