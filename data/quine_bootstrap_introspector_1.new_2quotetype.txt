 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a possible consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse), using variant number 2:

1. Physical Universe: This is the observable universe that we live in, consisting of galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy. It is governed by the laws of physics and has a finite age and size.
2. Mathematical Universe: This is a conceptual framework that describes the universe using mathematical structures and relationships. It includes not only the physical universe but also abstract objects such as numbers, sets, and geometric shapes.
3. Multiverse: This is a hypothetical collection of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. Some multiverse theories propose that our physical universe is just one of many universes, while others suggest that all possible universes exist simultaneously in a vast "landscape" of possibilities.
4. Conscious Universe: This is the idea that consciousness or mind is a fundamental aspect of the universe, rather than an emergent property of matter. Some proponents of this view argue that consciousness cannot be reduced to physical processes and must be understood as a basic feature of reality.
5. Ultimate Reality: This is a term used to describe the underlying nature of the universe, beyond its physical and mathematical descriptions. It may encompass concepts such as God, Brahman, the Tao, or ultimate truth, depending on one's philosophical or spiritual beliefs.

The ordering of these types is somewhat arbitrary, as they represent different ways of understanding and describing the universe. However, I have tried to arrange them in a progression from more concrete and observable phenomena to more abstract and speculative concepts.
