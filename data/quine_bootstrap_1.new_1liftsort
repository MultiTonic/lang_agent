 Result: Sure, I can provide a consecutive series of sorts to describe the universe and a universe of universes (multiverse) using variant number 1. Here's my ordering:

1. **Physical Universe**: This refers to the observable universe that we live in, including all matter, energy, space, and time. It is governed by laws of physics and consists of galaxies, stars, planets, and other celestial bodies.
2. **Multiverse (Variant 1: Infinite Universes)**: According to this variant, there exists an infinite number of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. These universes are disconnected from one another and exist in their own separate space-time continuums. The probability of any given universe having the same or similar properties as our own is infinitesimally small.
3. **Multiverse (Variant 2: Bubble Universes)**: In this variant, our physical universe is just one bubble in a vast sea of universes. Each bubble has its own set of fields and interactions, leading to different physical laws and properties. These bubbles can collide and interact with one another, potentially leading to the creation of new bubbles or the destruction of existing ones.
4. **Mathematical Universes**: This refers to the idea that mathematical structures and concepts exist independently of any physical universe. According to this view, there may be an infinite number of mathematical universes, each corresponding to a different set of mathematical structures and concepts. These universes may or may not have any connection to our physical universe.
5. **Consciousness Universes**: This refers to the idea that consciousness itself may exist independently of any physical or mathematical universe. According to this view, there may be an infinite number of conscious universes, each with its own set of experiences and perceptions. These universes may or may not have any connection to our physical or mathematical universes.
6. **Ultimate Ensemble**: This is the most inclusive concept of a universe, encompassing all possible universes, including physical, mathematical, and conscious universes. According to this view, there is no single "reality" but rather an infinite number of interconnected realities, each with its own set of properties and interactions.

I hope this answers your question! Let me know if you have any further queries.
