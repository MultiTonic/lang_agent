 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's one possible way to describe the universe and a "universe of universes" (also known as a multiverse) using a consecutive series of types:

1. **Object**: This is the most basic type, which can refer to any physical or conceptual entity that exists. Examples include particles, forces, fields, mathematical concepts, and abstract ideas.
2. **System**: A system is a collection of objects that interact with each other in some way. Systems can be simple or complex, and they can range from small scales (such as atoms or molecules) to large scales (such as galaxies or clusters of galaxies).
3. **Universe**: A universe is a self-contained system that contains all matter, energy, space, and time. It is the largest possible system, and it cannot be contained within any larger system. The universe is often described using theories such as general relativity and quantum mechanics.
4. **Multiverse**: A multiverse is a collection of universes, each of which may have its own set of objects, systems, and laws of physics. The concept of a multiverse is still speculative and not yet supported by empirical evidence, but it has been suggested as a way to explain certain features of our universe, such as the fine-tuning of physical constants.
5. **Theory**: A theory is a set of principles or concepts that describe and predict the behavior of objects and systems in a given domain. Theories can be tested through observation and experimentation, and they can be refined or replaced based on new evidence. Examples include the theory of relativity, the theory of quantum mechanics, and the standard model of particle physics.
6. **Philosophy**: Philosophy is a branch of knowledge that explores fundamental questions about reality, existence, knowledge, values, and ethics. It often deals with abstract concepts and ideas that cannot be directly observed or measured, but can still have important implications for our understanding of the universe and our place in it.

Using this ordering, we could describe the universe as a self-contained system that contains all matter, energy, space, and time, and we could describe a multiverse as a collection of universes, each with its own set of objects, systems, and laws of physics. We could then use theories to describe the behavior of objects and systems within these universes, and philosophy to explore the deeper questions about what it all means.
