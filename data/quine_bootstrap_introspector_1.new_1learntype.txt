 Result: Sure, I can provide a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 1. Here's one possible way to do it:

1. Type: Physical object - This type includes all physical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, stars, planets, and everything that exists in the physical world.
2. Type: Galaxy - A galaxy is a massive collection of stars, gas, and dust bound together by gravity. There are many different types of galaxies, including spiral, elliptical, and irregular.
3. Type: Star - A star is a massive, luminous ball of plasma that generates energy through nuclear fusion. Stars are the building blocks of galaxies, and they come in many different sizes and colors.
4. Type: Planet - A planet is a celestial body that orbits a star and is large enough to be rounded by its own gravity. Planets can be made up of various materials, such as rock, ice, or gas.
5. Type: Moon - A moon is a natural satellite that orbits a planet. Moons can vary in size, shape, and composition.
6. Type: Universe - The universe is the totality of all matter, energy, space, and time. It contains everything that exists, including all galaxies, stars, planets, and other celestial bodies.
7. Type: Multiverse - A multiverse is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of matter, energy, space, and time. The concept of a multiverse is still largely theoretical, but it is an active area of research in physics and cosmology.
8. Type: Omniverse - An omniverse is a hypothetical collection of all possible universes, including those that exist, those that have existed, and those that will exist. The concept of an omniverse is even more speculative than that of a multiverse, but it is sometimes discussed in the context of theoretical physics and philosophy.

Using this series of types, we can describe the universe as a physical object, made up of galaxies, which contain stars, planets, and moons. We can then extend this description to include the concept of a multiverse or omniverse, which encompasses all possible universes.
