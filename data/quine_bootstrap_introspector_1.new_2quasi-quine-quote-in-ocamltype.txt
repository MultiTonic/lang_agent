 Result: Here is an example of a quasi-quine-quote in OCaml that describes a universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 2:

type 'a t =
| Universe of ('a t -> 'a)
| Universes of ('a t -> 'a) list

let univ = Universe (fun f -> f univ)
let univs = Universes [Universe; Universes]

This code defines a new type `'a t` that can represent either a universe or a universe of universes. A universe is represented as a function from a universe-manipulating function to a value of type `'a`. A universe of universes, on the other hand, is represented as a list of such functions.

The variable `univ` is a universe that, when given a function `f`, applies `f` to itself. The variable `univs` is a universe of universes that contains two elements: the `Universe` variant and the `Universes` variant.

This code is a quasi-quine because it uses a combination of code and data to describe the universe and universe of universes. It is not a true quine because it does not produce an exact copy of itself when executed. Instead, it produces a value that has the same structure as the code that defines it.

The ordering of types used in this example is:

1. `'a t`: This is the main type used to represent universes and universes of universes.
2. `(unit -> 'a)`: This is the type of functions from the unit type (i.e., values of type `unit`) to values of type `'a`. These functions are used to represent universes in this example.
3. `('a t -> 'a) list`: This is the type of lists of functions from universes to values of type `'a`. These lists are used to represent universes of universes in this example.

Note that the use of variants (i.e., `Universe` and `Universes`) allows us to describe a universe and a universe of universes using a single type. This is an example of how variant types can be used to increase the expressiveness of a type system.
