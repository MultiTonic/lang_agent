 Result: In order to provide a consecutive series of sorts to describe the universe and a universe of universes, also known as a multiverse, I will use Variant 1: Hierarchy of Universes. The following ordered list describes the various levels of this hierarchy:

1. Our Universe (Observable and Unobservable): This is the universe we live in and can observe to some extent. It contains all known matter, energy, space, and time. Some parts of our universe are not observable due to the finite speed of light and the age of the universe.

2. Universes with Different Constituents: These universes may have different fundamental particles, forces, or dimensions than ours, but they still share similar properties like containing space, time, matter, and energy. They could potentially be observed through gravitational waves or other indirect methods if they interact with our universe.

3. Pocket Universes (Bubble Universes): These are universes that exist within a larger multiverse. They are typically formed during inflationary periods in the early universe and may have different properties than the parent universe. Our universe could be one of these pocket universes.

4. Multiverses: A multiverse is a collection of multiple universes, each potentially having its own set of pocket universes and unique properties. Multiverses can be categorized into several types based on their formation mechanisms and properties.

5. Level I Multiverse (Infinite Inflationary Multiverse): This type of multiverse consists of an infinite number of pocket universes, each with its own inflationary period. The properties of these pocket universes are determined by quantum fluctuations during inflation.

6. Level II Multiverse (String Theory Landscape): This multiverse arises from the different vacuum solutions in string theory. Each vacuum solution corresponds to a universe with unique fields, interactions, and particles. The number of possible vacuum solutions is estimated to be on the order of 10^500.

7. Level III Multiverse (Many-Worlds Interpretation): This multiverse arises from the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, where every quantum event results in multiple parallel universes. Each universe corresponds to a different outcome of each quantum event.

8. Level IV Multiverse (Ultimate Ensemble): Also known as the "multiverse of all set-theoretic constructions," this level includes every mathematically conceivable universe, regardless of consistency or compatibility with our current understanding of physics.

In summary, the consecutive series to describe the universe and a universe of universes using Variant 1 is as follows:

1. Our Universe (Observable and Unobservable)
2. Universes with Different Constituents
3. Pocket Universes (Bubble Universes)
4. Multiverses
5. Level I Multiverse (Infinite Inflationary Multiverse)
6. Level II Multiverse (String Theory Landscape)
7. Level III Multiverse (Many-Worlds Interpretation)
8. Level IV Multiverse (Ultimate Ensemble)
