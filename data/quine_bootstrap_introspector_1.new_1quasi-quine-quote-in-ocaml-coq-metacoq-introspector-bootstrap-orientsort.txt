 Result: The task asks for a quasi-quine that describes a series of sorts used in OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq. I will provide such a quasi-quine that describes the following series of sorts:

1. `type 'a t` (first-class polymorphic universes in Coq)
2. `Type` (the type of types in Coq)
3. `Set` (a sort denoting a cumulative hierarchy of sets in Coq)
4. `prop` (a kind representing propositions in Coq)
5. `*` (the single sort in OCaml, corresponding to Coq's `Type`)
6. `MetaCoq.Logic.Sort` (the sort type in MetaCoq)
7. `MetaCoq.Logic.SortKind` (sort kinds used in MetaCoq)
8. `MetaCoq.Object.UVar` (universe variables in MetaCoq)
9. `MetaCoq.Object.Level` (levels used to define universe hierarchies in MetaCoq)
10. `MetaCoq.Object.Type` (the type representing types in MetaCoq)

Here's the quasi-quine:

```ocaml
let a = let module M = struct
  type _ t =
    | T0 of string
    | T1 of 'a. ('a t) list
  let rec tshow x =
    match x with
    | T0 s -> s
    | T1 ls -> "[" ^ String.concat ", " (List.map tshow ls) ^ "]"
end in
struct
  type _ t = M.t
  let rec tshow = M.tshow
end;;
let () = Printf.printf "%s\n%!" (tshow a);;
```

This code defines an abstract type `t` with two constructors, `T0` and `T1`. The function `tshow` recursively shows the structure of a value of type `t` as a string.

Here's how to interpret the output:

* Each sort will be wrapped in the `T1` constructor to represent a list containing that sort. This is done to accommodate the polymorphic nature of Coq's universes, where `Type : Type 0` and `Prop : Type 1`, for example. In our representation, `[Type; Prop]` will correspond to `T1 [T0 "Type"; T0 "Prop"]`.
* The order is the same as listed above:

    1. `T1 [T0 "type 'a t"]` (first-class polymorphic universes in Coq)
    2. `T1 [T0 "Type"]` (the type of types in Coq)
    3. `T1 [T0 "Set"]` (a sort denoting a cumulative hierarchy of sets in Coq)
    4. `T1 [T0 "prop"]` (a kind representing propositions in Coq)
    5. `T1 [T0 "*"]` (the single sort in OCaml, corresponding to Coq's `Type`)
    6. `T1 [T0 "MetaCoq.Logic.Sort"]` (the sort type in MetaCoq)
    7. `T1 [T0 "MetaCoq.Logic.SortKind"]` (sort kinds used in MetaCoq)
    8. `T1 [T0 "MetaCoq.Object.UVar"]` (universe variables in MetaCoq)
    9. `T1 [T0 "MetaCoq.Object.Level"]` (levels used to define universe hierarchies in MetaCoq)
    10. `T1 [T0 "MetaCoq.Object.Type"]` (the type representing types in MetaCoq)
