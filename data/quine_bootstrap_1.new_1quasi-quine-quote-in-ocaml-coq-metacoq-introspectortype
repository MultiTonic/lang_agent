 Result: I am not familiar with a specific "ordering" for describing the universe and universe of universes using a quasi-quine-quote in OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq. However, I can provide you with an example of how one might go about creating such a quasi-quine in OCaml, and then discuss how it could be extended to include Coq and MetaCoq, as well as describe the universe and universe of universes.

A quasi-quine is a program that outputs its own source code, possibly with some modifications. Here's an example of a simple quasi-quine in OCaml:

```ocaml
let q = "let q = %S; print_string q;"
in print_string (String.sub q 12 ((String.length q) - 13))
```

This program defines a string `q` that contains the entire source code of the program, with the exception of the first 12 characters. It then uses `print_string` to output everything starting from the 12th character until the end of the string.

Now, let's discuss how we could extend this example to include Coq and MetaCoq, as well as describe the universe and universe of universes. To do so, I would suggest a modular approach, where we create separate modules for each system (OCaml, Coq, MetaCoq) and then combine them together.

For OCaml, we already have a simple quasi-quine example above. For Coq, a similar approach could be taken using the `Print` command from the Coq standard library. Here's an example:

```coq
Definition q := Print "Definition q := %t; q.".
Qed.
```

This program defines a constant `q` that contains the entire source code of the program, with the exception of the first 13 characters. It then uses `Print` to output everything starting from the 14th character until the end of the string.

For MetaCoq, which is an extension of Coq that provides a formalization of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC), we would need to use its facilities for representing terms and their typing derivations. Here's an example:

```coq
Require Import Coq.Init.Logic.

Definition q := ltac:(print_string "Definition q := ltac:(print_string \\\"%s\\\"); q.").
Qed.
```

This program defines a constant `q` that contains the entire source code of the program, with the exception of the first 13 characters and uses Ltac command to print it out.

To combine these examples into a single quasi-quine for OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq would require some additional work. However, a general approach could involve defining a datatype that represents terms in each system and then writing a function that recursively traverses the datatype to produce the desired output.

As for describing the universe and universe of universes, this is a complex topic in type theory, with various interpretations and approaches. One possible way to include it in our quasi-quine would be to extend our datatype to include universes and then modify our printing function to output appropriate descriptions of them. However, this would require a deep understanding of the specific approach to universes being used and is beyond the scope of this example.
