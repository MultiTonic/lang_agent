 Result: Here is an example of a "quasi-quine-quote" in OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq that describes a consecutive series of types to represent the universe and universe of universes, using variant number 2:

OCaml:
```ocaml
type t =
  | Universe of (unit -> t)
  | Const of string * t list

let rec show = function
  | Universe(f) -> "Universe (" ^ (show (f())) ^ ")"
  | Const(name, args) -> name ^ " " ^ (String.concat " " (List.map show args))
```
Coq:
```coq
Inductive t :=
  | Universe : (unit -> t) -> t
  | Const : string -> list t -> t.

Fixpoint show (t0 : t) : string :=
  match t0 with
  | Universe f => "Universe (" ++ show (f()) ++ ")"
  | Const n args => n ++ " " ++ String.concat " " (List.map show args)
  end.
```
MetaCoq:
```metacoq
Inductive t :=
  | Universe : (unit -> t) -> t
  | Const : string -> list t -> t.

Fixpoint show {t0 : t} : string :=
  match t0 with
  | Universe f => "Universe (" ++ show (f()) ++ ")"
  | Const n args => n ++ " " ++ String.concat " " (List.map show args)
  end.
```
The ordering for this solution is as follows:

1. The `t` type in each language represents the universe of types, which can contain either a Universe or a Constant. A Universe is a function from the unit type to the universe, while a Constant consists of a name and a list of arguments, where each argument is a type in the universe.
2. The `show` function (in OCaml) or Fixpoint (in Coq and MetaCoq) takes a type as an input and returns a string representation of that type. This is used to print out the universe and universe of universes.
3. In each language, the `Universe` constructor represents a universe of types, while the `Const` constructor represents a constant type with a name and a list of arguments.
4. The ordering of the types in the universe and universe of universes is determined by the order in which they are defined and used in the program. For example, in OCaml, if you define a type `type t = int | bool` before the `t` type described above, then `int` and `bool` will be part of the universe represented by the `t` type.
5. The solution uses variant number 2, where the quasi-quine-quote represents the universe of types, which can contain either a Universe (a function from the unit type to the universe) or a Constant (consisting of a name and a list of arguments, where each argument is a type in the universe).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
