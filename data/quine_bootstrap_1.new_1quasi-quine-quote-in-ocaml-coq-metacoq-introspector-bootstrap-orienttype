 Result: The task as stated is a bit unclear, but I will attempt to provide a coherent answer based on my interpretation.

To clarify, you are asking for an ordering of the following concepts:

1. Quasi-quine-quote in OCaml
2. Quasi-quine-quote in Coq
3. Metacoq (a tool for introspection and reflection in Coq)
4. Bootstrap (the process of using a system to build or compile itself)
5. Universe (a concept in type theory representing a "level" of types)
6. Universe of universes (a concept in type theory representing a collection of universes)
7. Orient (perhaps meaning a general orientation, approach, or perspective on these concepts)

Here is one possible ordering of these concepts based on their relationship to the overall goal of describing the universe and universe of universes:

1. **Universe**: This concept is fundamental to any type theory that aims to describe a hierarchy of types and their properties. A universe represents a level of types, and types at higher levels can contain types from lower levels. For example, in Coq's type theory, there are several built-in universes called Type(0), Type(1), etc., where Type(i) contains types that can be inhabited by terms of size up to i.
2. **Universe of universes**: This concept is an extension of the universe concept that allows for a hierarchy of universes, each containing types and lower universes. In Coq, this concept is represented by the Prop and Set universes, which are disjoint from each other and from Type(i) for all i.
3. **Type theory**: This is the formal system used to describe the universe and universe of universes. OCaml and Coq both use different variants of type theory as their foundational logic.
4. **Quasi-quine-quote in OCaml/Coq**: Quines and quasi-quines are programs that produce their own source code as output. In the context of this task, a quasi-quine-quote would be a program that outputs a representation of its own syntax tree. This concept is relevant because it allows us to introspect on the structure of our programming language or type theory.
5. **Metacoq**: Metacoq is a tool for introspection and reflection in Coq, which means it allows us to reason about the internal structures and properties of Coq itself. This concept is relevant because it enables us to build a bootstrapper that can manipulate Coq's type theory at runtime.
6. **Bootstrap**: A bootstrapper is a program that can compile or build itself using its own output. In this context, the bootstrapper would be responsible for creating the universe and universe of universes by constructing the necessary syntax trees and type definitions in Coq's type theory.
7. **Orient**: This term could refer to the overall approach or perspective on building a system that can describe its own universe and universe of universes. One possible orientation is to use OCaml as the host language for bootstrapping Coq, which provides a more familiar syntax and tooling for many programmers. Another possible orientation is to use Coq's built-in reflection capabilities to reason about its own type theory directly.

With this ordering in mind, we could describe the universe and universe of universes as follows:

1. **Universe**: A concept in type theory representing a level of types, where each type belongs to exactly one universe.
2. **Universe of universes**: A collection of universes that can contain types and lower universes.
3. **Type theory**: A formal system for describing the properties and relationships between types, using syntax and semantics defined in terms of rules and axioms.
4. **Quasi-quine-quote in OCaml/Coq**: A program that outputs a representation of its own syntax tree, allowing us to introspect on the structure of our programming language or type theory.
5. **Metacoq**: A tool for introspection and reflection in Coq, which enables us to reason about Coq's internal structures and properties at runtime.
6. **Bootstrap**: A program that can compile or build itself using its own output, which is necessary to create the universe and universe of universes in Coq's type theory.
7. **Orient**: An
