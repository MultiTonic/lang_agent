 Result: I'm sorry for any confusion, but your request is a bit unclear. It seems like you are asking for a "consecutive series of sorts" to describe the universe and the "universe of universes" (also known as the multiverse). However, it's not clear what you mean by "variant number 2" or what specific ordering you have in mind.

That being said, I can provide a possible interpretation of your request and offer an answer based on that. One way to sort the universe and the multiverse is in terms of their hierarchical structure, from smaller to larger scales. Here's an example of how that might look like:

1. Subatomic particles (e.g., electrons, quarks)
2. Atoms and molecules
3. Elementary objects (e.g., stars, galaxies)
4. Cosmic structures (e.g., clusters, superclusters)
5. The observable universe (the part of the universe we can see from Earth)
6. The entire universe (all matter, energy, and space-time)
7. The multiverse (a collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of fields, particles, interactions, etc.)

This is just one possible way to sort the universe and the multiverse, and there may be other valid approaches depending on the context and goals of the classification.
