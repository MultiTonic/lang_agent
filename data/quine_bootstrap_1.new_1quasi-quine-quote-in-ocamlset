 Result: Here is a quasi-quine in OCaml that describes a universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 1:

```ocaml
let ( = ) s s' = String.equal s s'

let qq =
  let open String in
  let rec quote i s =
    if i = length s then ""
    else quote (succ i) (sub s 0 i) ^ "'" ^ sub s i (pred (length s)) ^ "\n"
  in
  let rec univ i s =
    if i = 1 then "Universe\n" ^ quote 0 s
    else "Universe of universes\n" ^ quote 0 ("univ " ^ string_of_int i ^ "\n" ^ s)
  in
  let uovaluation = univ 2 "univ 1 = 'Universe'\nuniv 2 = 'Universe of universes'\n" in
  uovaluation ^ quote 0 ("let ( = ) s s' = String.equal s s' in\n" ^ uovaluation)

print_endline qq
```

This program defines a function `quote` that takes a string and an index `i`, and returns the substring up to the `i`th character, followed by a single quote, followed by the substring starting at the `i`th character, followed by a newline. It then defines a function `univ` that takes an integer `i` and a string `s`, and returns either "Universe" followed by the result of calling `quote` on `s`, or "Universe of universes" followed by the result of calling `quote` on a string that includes the definition of `univ` with argument `i+1` and the string `s`.

The main part of the program defines a string `uovaluation` that contains the definitions of `univ` for `i=2` and `i=1`, using the `quote` function to include the definitions in the string itself. It then returns the result of calling `quote` on a string that includes the definition of `( = )`, followed by the definition of `uovaluation`.

This program is a quasi-quine because it produces output that is almost identical to its own source code, but with some differences due to the use of the `quote` function. The output describes a universe (the string containing the definition of `( = )`) and a universe of universes (the string containing the definitions of `univ`, `uovaluation`, and the result of calling `quote` on their concatenation). The ordering of the universes is determined by the order in which they are defined in `uovaluation`. In this case, the universe of universes is defined first, followed by the universe.
