 Result: Variant 1:

1. The concept of a universe: A universe is typically defined as the totality of all matter, energy, space, and time that exists. It is a self-contained system that is not part of any larger structure.
2. The observable universe: This is the portion of the universe that we can directly observe and measure using telescopes and other scientific instruments. It is estimated to be about 93 billion light years in diameter.
3. The multiverse: This is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, including our own. Each universe within the multiverse may have its own set of matter, energy, space, and time.
4. The metaverse: This term has been used to describe a hypothetical universe that exists beyond the multiverse, encompassing all possible universes and concepts of reality. It is a concept that is often explored in science fiction and philosophy.
5. The ultimate ensemble: This is a theoretical construct proposed by physicist Max Tegmark, which suggests that every possible mathematical structure corresponds to a universe. It includes all conceivable forms of matter, energy, space, and time, as well as abstract concepts such as numbers and geometric shapes.
6. The level IV multiverse: This is the highest level in Tegmark's hierarchy of universes, which encompasses every possible mathematical structure that can be described by a consistent set of equations. It includes all conceivable forms of reality, including those beyond our current understanding or comprehension.
