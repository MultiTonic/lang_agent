We are building a prompt software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Launch doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: Ast connected with Term . What is your response? Please generate prompt variant array of size 5

 Result: Sure, I understand that you want me to create prompts for a software generator that generates OCaml code with Coq proofs. The prompts should use the given context creatively and forgivingly, and there should be 5 variants in total. Here are five possible prompts:

1. "Imagine you're tasked with launching an introspection of an executable's AST in OCaml, connected to a Term object in our proof engine. How would you structure the prompt for our software generator?"
2. "We need to create an executable that runs an introspection on its own AST and generates Coq proofs. Using our adaptive language agent architecture, how could we design a prompt that achieves this?"
3. "Suppose we want to generate OCaml code that launches an introspection of a Term object in the proof engine, with the resulting AST saved as an executable file. How would you construct a prompt for this task?"
4. "Consider a scenario where we need to connect an Ast object in our proof engine to a corresponding Term object, while generating Coq proofs in OCaml. Can you come up with a prompt that could accomplish this?"
5. "Think about a use case where we want to create an executable file from an introspection of a Term object in the proof engine, while also generating Coq proofs for the AST. How would you formulate a prompt for this complex task?"
