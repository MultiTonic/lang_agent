 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here is one possible way to lift a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using Variant Number 1:

1. The first set in this hierarchy could be the set of all physical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, stars, planets, and living organisms. This set could be denoted as U = {all physical objects}.
2. The second set in this hierarchy could be the set of all possible states or configurations that these physical objects can take on. This set could be denoted as S = {all possible states of U}.
3. The third set in this hierarchy could be the set of all possible laws of physics that govern the behavior of these physical objects and their states. This set could be denoted as L = {all possible laws of physics}.
4. The fourth set in this hierarchy could be the set of all possible universes, each with its own set of physical objects, possible states, and laws of physics. This set could be denoted as U' = {all possible universes}.
5. Finally, the fifth set in this hierarchy could be the set of all possible multiverses, each containing multiple universes with their own sets of physical objects, possible states, and laws of physics. This set could be denoted as M = {all possible multiverses}.

Using this ordering, we can describe the universe as U ∈ S ⊂ L ⊂ U' ⊂ M. In other words, the universe is a subset of all possible states of its physical objects, which are governed by some set of laws of physics, and which exist within some larger universe, which in turn exists within some even larger multiverse.
