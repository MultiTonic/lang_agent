We are bootstrapping a new system using EBNF grammars.
We want to make an ebnf grammar that is super detailed.
for each rule we want to create a nameing rule for the rules that have them all start with prd. each token should be called tkn.
if a token is used in a rule lets make it prd_<prod name>_tkn_<token name>
Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Lets create a new EBNF that is more expressive and explicit.

 Result: Sure! Here is an example of how you could define your EBNF grammar with the naming conventions you described:

```
(* EBNF grammar for a folder *)

(* A folder contains a list of files and subfolders *)
prd_folder  -> '[' ( prd_file | prd_subfolder ) ']' ;

(* A file is defined by its name and extension *)
prd_file    -> tkn_file_name tkn_extension ;

(* A subfolder is defined by its name and contents *)
prd_subfolder -> tkn_subfolder_name prd_folder ;

(* File name, extension, and subfolder name are any sequence of letters and digits *)
tkn_file_name   -> [a-zA-Z0-9]+ ;
tkn_extension   -> '.' [a-zA-Z0-9]+ ;
tkn_subfolder_name  -> [a-zA-Z0-9]+ ;
```

This EBNF grammar defines a folder as a list of files and subfolders, where both files and subfolders have names. Files also have an extension, which is a sequence of letters and digits following a dot (`.`). The naming conventions you specified are used for all the rules and tokens.

To use this EBNF grammar to parse a folder, you would need to define the `op` function and the initial accumulator value for the `fold_left` function. For example:

```
let op acc file_or_subfolder =
  match file_or_subfolder with
  | Tkn_file (name, ext) -> name :: ext :: acc
  | Tkn_subfolder (name, contents) -> name :: contents :: acc
in

let parse_folder ebnf_grammar folder_string =
  let lexed_tokens = Lexer.tokenize ebnf_grammar folder_string in
  fold_left op [] lexed_tokens
```

This `parse_folder` function takes an EBNF grammar and a folder string as input, tokenizes the folder string using the `Lexer.tokenize` function, and then uses the `fold_left` function to parse the tokens into a list of file names, extensions, and subfolder names. The `op` function is used to pattern match on each file or subfolder token and append its name and contents to the accumulator list.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
