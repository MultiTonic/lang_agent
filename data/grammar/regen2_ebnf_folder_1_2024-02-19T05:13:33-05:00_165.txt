We are bootstrapping a new system using EBNF grammars.
We want to make an ebnf grammar that is super detailed.
for each rule we want to create a nameing rule for the rules that have them all start with prd. each token should be called tkn.
if a token is used in a rule lets make it prd_<prod name>_tkn_<token name>
Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Lets create a new EBNF that is more expressive and explicit.

 Result: Here's an example of how you could define your EBNF grammar with the naming conventions you described:
```ebnf
<prd_folder_tkn_grammar> ::= <tkn_A>

<prd_previous_results_tkn_results> ::= <tkn_D>

<prd_initial_example_tkn_initial_example> ::= <tkn_B>

<prd_new_example_tkn_new_example> ::= <tkn_C>

<prd_output_tkn_created_new_output> ::= <tkn_D>

<prd_test_tkn_test> ::= <tkn_D>

<prd_loop_tkn_repeat_loop> ::= <tkn_IF> ( <prd_test_tkn_test> = <tkn_GOOD> ) ( <prd_fold_left_tkn_operation> ( <tkn_NEW> <prd_output_tkn_created_new_output> ) ( <prd_previous_results_tkn_results> ) ) ( <tkn_ELSE} > ( <prd_feed_error_tkn_feed_error_back> ( <tkn_UP_TO> <tkn_3> <prd_times_tkn_times> ) )

<prd_fold_left_tkn_operation> ::= <tkn_FOLD_LEFT> <tkn_OP> <tkn_ACCUMULATOR> ( <tkn_H_HEAD> :: <tkn_T_TAIL} )
```
In this example, I've defined the rules for each of the inputs and operations described in your code, using the naming conventions you specified. For example, the rule `<prd_grammar_tkn_grammar>` represents the grammar input, `A`, and is named according to the convention you described (i.e., starting with "prd" and followed by the name of the input in lowercase).

Similarly, I've defined rules for the previous results (`<prd_previous_results_tkn_results>`), initial example (`<prd_initial_example_tkn_initial_example>`), new example (`<prd_new_example_tkn_new_example>`), and created new output (`<prd_output_tkn_created_new_output>`) inputs.

I've also defined a rule for the `fold_left` operation, which is represented by the `<prd_fold_left_tkn_operation>` rule. This rule includes the `OP`, `ACCUMULATOR`, `H` (head), and `T` (tail) tokens, as well as the `::` token to represent list construction.

Finally, I've defined a rule for the loop operation, which is represented by the `<prd_loop_tkn_repeat_loop>` rule. This rule includes the conditions for repeating the loop (i.e., if the test result is "good") and for feeding an error back into the system (i.e., if the test result is not "good"). The loop operation also includes the `UP_TO` and `TIMES` tokens to specify the number of times the loop should be repeated.

Note that this is just one possible way to define your EBNF grammar using the naming conventions you described. There may be other ways to structure the grammar that are more suitable for your specific needs.
