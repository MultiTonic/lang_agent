We are bootstrapping a new system using EBNF grammars.
We want to make an ebnf grammar that is super detailed.
for each rule we want to create a nameing rule for the rules that have them all start with prd. each token should be called tkn.
if a token is used in a rule lets make it prd_<prod name>_tkn_<token name>
Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Lets create a new EBNF that is more expressive and explicit.

#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Here is an example of an EBNF grammar with the requested naming conventions:

<BNF\_GRAMMAR> ::= 'let' 'rec' <FOLD\_LEFT\_DEFN>

<FOLD\_LEFT\_DEFN> ::= <IDENTIFIER> '=' 'fun' 'acc' '->' <OP\_DEFN> ('|' <OP\_DEFN>) '\*'

<OP\_DEFN> ::= <IDENTIFIER> '(' [<EXPR> '::' <EXPR>] ')' '->' <EXPR>

<EXPR> ::= <IDENTIFIER> | '<' <TOKEN> '>'

<IDENTIFIER> ::= 'prd' <WORD> ('\_' 'tkn' '\_' <WORD>)?'

<WORD> ::= [a-zA-Z]+[a-zA-Z0-9]*

<TOKEN> ::= 'prd' <WORD> '\_' <IDENTIFIER> '\_tkn\_' <WORD>

In this grammar:

* The name of each rule starts with "prd" followed by the original rule name.
* Each token is named "prd\_<rule\_name>\_tkn\_<token\_name>".
* Fold left definition consists of a function name, formal parameter acc, and the sequence of operation definitions separated by '|'
* Operation definition starts with an identifier followed by parenthesized zero or one expression list, then '->' and another expression.
* Expressions can be either identifiers or tokens.

Note: This is just a simple example to illustrate the naming conventions you requested, and it might not cover all your use cases. You may need to add additional rules and/or modify this grammar based on your specific requirements.
