Consider the following grammar between BEGINSRC and ENDSRC. BEGINSRC  
%{
open Syntax
%}

%token <int> Tchar
%token DASH "-"
%token CARET "^"
%token
  BAR              "|"
  EOF              ""
 ENDSRC . Please rewrite it to be more beautiful. We are going to use the following TARGET: BEGINTARGET comment ::= "#" [a-zA-Z0-9 \t]*
letter ::= [a-zA-Z]
digit ::= [0-9]
S ::= ( " " | "\n" | "\t" | "\r"  )
symbol ::= "[" | "]" | "{" | "}" | "(" | ")" | "<" | ">"  | "'" |  "=" | "|" | "." | "," | ";" | "-"        | "+" | "*" | "?" 
character ::= letter | digit | symbol | "_" | " "
identifier ::= letter ( letter | digit | "_" )*
terminal ::= "'" character  "'"  ( character  "'" )  "'"
terminator ::= (";" | ".") 
term ::= "("   S   rhs   S   ")"      | "["   S   rhs   S   "]"      | "{"   S   rhs   S   "}"      | terminal      | identifier
factor ::= term  S  "?"         | term   S   "*"        | term   S   "+"        | term   S   "-"   S   term        | term   S
concatenation ::= ( S   factor   S   "," ? ) +
alternation ::= ( S   concatenation   S   "|" ? ) +
rhs ::= alternation
lhs ::= identifier
rule ::= lhs   S   "="   S   rhs   S   terminator comment*
root ::= comment* ( S   rule   S ) * ENDTARGET as our target grammar format. Please rewrite SRC into TARGET. You are to only respond using the target custom GBNF grammar with no descriptions or comments. Please start with a comment using '#' to start comments on a new line.

 Result:
