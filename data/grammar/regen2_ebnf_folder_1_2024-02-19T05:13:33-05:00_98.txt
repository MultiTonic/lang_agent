We are bootstrapping a new system using EBNF grammars.
We want to make an ebnf grammar that is super detailed.
for each rule we want to create a nameing rule for the rules that have them all start with prd. each token should be called tkn.
if a token is used in a rule lets make it prd_<prod name>_tkn_<token name>
Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Lets create a new EBNF that is more expressive and explicit.

 Result: Here's an example of how you could define your EBNF grammar with the naming conventions you described:

<bnf>
= ('\(' <prod> ')' <assoc>)? '=' <expr> ';'

<prod>
= 'prd_' <id>

<assoc>
= 'left' / 'right' / 'nonassoc'

<expr>
= <term> { ('+' / '-') <term> }

<term>
= <factor> { ('*' / '/') <factor> }

<factor>
= '(' <expr> ')'
/ prd_<prod\_name>\_tkn\_<token\_name>
/ prd_<prod\_name>\_tkn\_<token\_name>{ prd\_<prod\_name>\_tkn\_<token\_name> }+

<id>
= [a-zA-Z]+

<token\_name>
= [a-zA-Z0-9]+
</bnf>

In this EBNF grammar, each rule starts with "prd\_" to indicate that it is a production. Each token is prefixed with "tkn\_" and includes the name of the production it belongs to (e.g. prd\_expr\_tkn\_PLUS). The nonterminals are defined in the usual way, and the associativity of operators is specified using the 'left', 'right', or 'nonassoc' keywords.

Note that this is just an example and may need to be adapted to suit your specific needs.
