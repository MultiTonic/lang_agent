We are bootstrapping a new system using EBNF grammars.
We want to make an ebnf grammar that is super detailed.
for each rule we want to create a nameing rule for the rules that have them all start with prd. each token should be called tkn.
if a token is used in a rule lets make it prd_<prod name>_tkn_<token name>
Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Lets create a new EBNF that is more expressive and explicit.

#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Here is an example of an EBNF grammar with the requested naming conventions:

<BNF> ::= '(' *[ <prod\_name> '=' <prod\_def> ] ')' .

<prod\_def> ::= <prod\_body> | <seq\_def> .

<prod\_body> ::= [ <opt\_mod> ] [ <rep\_mod> ] <rule> .

<seq\_def> ::= '{' *[ <prod\_name> ( ',' <prod\_name> )* ] '}' .

<opt\_mod> ::= '[' <prod\_body> ']' | '[' '?' <prod\_body> ']' .

<rep\_mod> ::= '{' <prod\_body> '}' | '{' <prod\_body> '*' '}' .

<rule> ::= <term> [ '|' <rule> ]* .

<term> ::= <lit\_tkn> | <alt\_tkn> | <seq\_tkn> | <opt\_tkn> | <rep\_tkn> .

<lit\_tkn> ::= '\'' <char\_set> '\\'' .

<alt\_tkn> ::= '"' <char\_set> '\"' .

<seq\_tkn> ::= '<' <char\_set> '>' .

<opt\_tkn> ::= '[' <term> ']' .

<rep\_tkn> ::= '{' <term> '}' | '{' <term> '*' '}' .

<char\_set> ::= <char> [ <char> ]* .

The above EBNF grammar defines a new EBNF syntax with the following features:

* Each production is enclosed in parentheses and has a name. For example, `<prod_name>` can be replaced with a specific production name such as `<folder>`.
* The body of each production can have optional or repetition modifiers applied to it using square brackets (`[...]`) or curly braces (`{...}`), respectively.
* Each terminal symbol is represented by a token, which can be either a literal string (using single quotes), an alternative string (using double quotes), a sequence of characters (using angle brackets), an optional term (using square brackets), or a repetition term (using curly braces).

Note: This EBNF grammar is just an example and may not be suitable for your specific needs. It can be further customized to add more features as necessary.
