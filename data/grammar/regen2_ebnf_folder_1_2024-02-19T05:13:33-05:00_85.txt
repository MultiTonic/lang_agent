We are bootstrapping a new system using EBNF grammars.
We want to make an ebnf grammar that is super detailed.
for each rule we want to create a nameing rule for the rules that have them all start with prd. each token should be called tkn.
if a token is used in a rule lets make it prd_<prod name>_tkn_<token name>
Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Lets create a new EBNF that is more expressive and explicit.

 Result: Here's an example of how you can define your EBNF grammar with the naming conventions you described:

EBNF Grammar:

<folder> ::= prd\_folder\_tkn\_name = <identifier> ";"
           | prd\_folder\_tkn\_rules = [ <rule> ]

<rule> ::= prd\_rule\_tkn\_name = <sequence>

<sequence> ::= <element>
            | <sequence> "|" <element>

<element> ::= <token>
           | <group>
           | <option>
           | <repeat>

<group> ::= "(" <sequence> ")"

<option> ::= "[" <sequence> "]"

<repeat> ::= "{" <sequence> "}"

<token> ::= prd\_tkn\_identifier = <identifier>
         | prd\_tkn\_integer = <integer>
         | prd\_tkn\_string = <quoted\_string>

;

In this EBNF grammar, each rule starts with "prd\_" followed by the name of the rule. Each token in a rule is prefixed with "prd\_tkn\_". For example, the token for an identifier is named "prd\_tkn\_identifier". If a token is used in a rule, its name is suffixed with "_<token name>", such as "prd\_folder\_tkn\_name" or "prd\_rule\_tkn\_name". This naming convention makes it easy to understand the structure and components of the grammar.

You can use this EBNF grammar as a starting point for your bootstrapping system, and modify it as needed to suit your specific requirements. The "fold\_left" function you provided can be used to recursively apply operations to the elements of the grammar, making it easy to perform transformations or analysis on the grammar as a whole.
