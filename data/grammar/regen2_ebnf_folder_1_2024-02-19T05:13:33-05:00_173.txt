We are bootstrapping a new system using EBNF grammars.
We want to make an ebnf grammar that is super detailed.
for each rule we want to create a nameing rule for the rules that have them all start with prd. each token should be called tkn.
if a token is used in a rule lets make it prd_<prod name>_tkn_<token name>
Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Lets create a new EBNF that is more expressive and explicit.

#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Here is an example of how you could define an EBNF grammar with your naming conventions based on the `fold_left` function:
```
<prd_fold_left_tkn_function> ::= <tkn_list> | <tkn_op> <tkn_acc> <tkn_function> <tkn_list>
<prd_list_tkn_list> ::= '[' <tkn_entry> {',' <tkn_entry>} ']'
<prd_entry_tkn_entry> ::= <tkn_element> | <tkn_empty>
<prd_element_tkn_element> ::= <any_token>
<prd_op_tkn_op> ::= <any_operator>
<prd_acc_tkn_acc> ::= <any_variable>
<prd_function_tkn_function> ::= 'fold_left'
```
In this example, `<tkn_*>` represents the tokens named according to your convention. The `<any_*>` represents any valid token that fits the description in the rule.

You can continue defining the rest of the grammar following the same naming conventions and rules.

Please note that this is just an example, you may need to adjust it based on the specific requirements and context of your system.
