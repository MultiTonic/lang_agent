We are bootstrapping a new system using EBNF grammars.
We want to make an ebnf grammar that is super detailed.
for each rule we want to create a nameing rule for the rules that have them all start with prd. each token should be called tkn.
if a token is used in a rule lets make it prd_<prod name>_tkn_<token name>
Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Lets create a new EBNF that is more expressive and explicit.

 Result: Here's an example of how you could define your EBNF grammar with the naming conventions you described:

```ebnf
<folder> ::= prd_folder_tkn_name ':' prd_folder_tkn_inputs '{'
                  <input>*
              '}'

<input> ::= prd_input_tkn_grammar ':' prd_input_tkn_grammar_identifier
           | prd_input_tkn_previous_results ':' prd_input_tkn_previous_results_identifier
           | prd_input_tkn_new_example ':' prd_input_tkn_new_example_identifier
           | prd_input_tkn_created_new_output ':' prd_input_tkn_created_new_output_identifier
<grammar_identifier> ::= 'A'
<previous_results_identifier> ::= 'D'
<new_example_identifier> ::= 'C'
<created_new_output_identifier> ::= 'D'
<test> ::= prd_test_tkn_if '(' prd_test_tkn_good ')' '{' <loop> '}'
<loop> ::= prd_loop_tkn_repeat '[' <number> ']' '{' <create_new_D> '}'
<number> ::= '3'
<create_new_D> ::= prd_create_new_D_tkn_start '{' <rewrite_code> '}'
<rewrite_code> ::= prd_rewrite_code_tkn_with '(' prd_rewrite_code_tkn_suit_needs ')' ';'
```

This EBNF grammar follows the naming conventions you described, with each rule starting with "prd\_" and each token being called "tkn" followed by a more descriptive name. It also includes the input variables and the operations that need to be performed on them, as well as the test and loop conditions.

Please note that this is just an example of how you could structure your EBNF grammar, it might not fully suit your needs or work as expected in a real-world scenario. But it should give you a good starting point for building out your own detailed and expressive EBNF grammar.
