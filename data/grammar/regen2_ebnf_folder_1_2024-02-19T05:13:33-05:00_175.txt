We are bootstrapping a new system using EBNF grammars.
We want to make an ebnf grammar that is super detailed.
for each rule we want to create a nameing rule for the rules that have them all start with prd. each token should be called tkn.
if a token is used in a rule lets make it prd_<prod name>_tkn_<token name>
Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Lets create a new EBNF that is more expressive and explicit.

#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Here's an example of how you could define your EBNF grammar with the naming conventions you specified:

```
<prd_folder_tkn_input> ::= prd\_folder\_tkn\_grammar ':' <prd_tkn_identifier>
                          | prd\_folder\_tkn_previousResults ':' <prd_tkn_identifier>
                          | prd\_folder\_tkn_newExample ':' <prd_tkn_identifier>
                          | prd\_folder\_tkn_createdOutput ':' <prd_tkn_identifier>

<prd_tkn_identifier> ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*

<prd_folder_tkn_test> ::= prd\_folder\_tkn\_ifGood ':' prd\_folder\_tkn\_testPassed '?' <prd_tkn_identifier> ':' <prd_tkn_identifier>
                         | prd\_folder\_tkn\_repeatLoop ':' prd\_folder\_tkn\_times '?' <prd_tkn_integer>

<prd_tkn_integer> ::= [0-9]+

<prd_folder_tkn_errorFeedback> ::= prd\_folder\_tkn\_feedErrorBack ':' prd\_folder\_tkn\_times '?' <prd_tkn_integer>

<startSymbol> ::= <prd_folder_tkn_input> <prd_folder_tkn_test> <prd_folder_tkn_repeatLoop> <prd_folder_tkn_errorFeedback>
```

This EBNF grammar defines the `folder` production, which takes in four inputs: a grammar identifier, a previous results identifier, a new example identifier, and a created output identifier. It also includes rules for testing the created output and repeating the loop if necessary, as well as an error feedback rule that allows for up to three attempts at creating a valid output.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
