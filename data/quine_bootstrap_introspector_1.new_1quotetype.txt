 Result: Sure, I can provide a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse). Here's one way to do it, using a hierarchy of sets:

1. Set: A collection of unique objects, called elements or members, that can be anything from numbers to physical objects to other sets.
2. Proper class: A collection of sets that is too big to be a set itself, but still has well-defined properties and relationships between its elements. The universe of sets is an example of a proper class.
3. Multiverse: A collection of universes, each of which is a proper class of sets. Each universe may have different properties and relationships between its elements, and there may be many different ways to define and relate the universes within a multiverse.
4. Meta-multiverse: A collection of multiverses, each of which contains multiple universes with their own sets and properties. This is a more speculative concept that goes beyond current scientific understanding, but it is sometimes used in theoretical physics and cosmology to describe possible higher-level structures in the universe(s).

In this hierarchy, each type is a subset of the type above it, and contains all of the elements of the type below it. The universe of sets contains all sets, the multiverse contains all universes (each of which contains all sets within that universe), and the meta-multiverse contains all multiverses (each of which contains all universes within that multiverse). This is just one possible way to describe the universe and a universe of universes using set theory, and there are many other ways to approach this question using different mathematical or philosophical frameworks.
