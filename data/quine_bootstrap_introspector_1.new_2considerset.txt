 Result: For variant number 2, one possible ordering for a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and universe of universes could be as follows:

1. The physical universe: This set would contain all matter, energy, space, and time that exist within our observable universe. It would include galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter, as well as all the forces and interactions between them.
2. The multiverse: This set would contain all possible universes, including the physical universe. It would include all possible configurations of matter, energy, space, and time, including those that are radically different from our own universe.
3. The mathematical universe: This set would contain all mathematical structures, objects, and relationships. It would include numbers, shapes, functions, sets, and all other mathematical concepts, as well as the rules that govern their behavior.
4. The logical universe: This set would contain all possible logical systems, axioms, and proofs. It would include classical logic, intuitionistic logic, modal logic, and all other forms of formal reasoning.
5. The conceptual universe: This set would contain all concepts, ideas, and meanings that can be expressed or understood by intelligent beings. It would include language, culture, art, science, philosophy, and all other forms of human knowledge and experience.
6. The meta-universe: This set would contain all possible frameworks, models, or theories that can describe or explain the other universes. It would include ontology, epistemology, metaphysics, and all other forms of philosophical inquiry.

Note that this ordering is just one possible way to arrange the sets, and there may be other valid ways to do so depending on one's assumptions and perspectives.
