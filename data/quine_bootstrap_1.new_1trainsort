 Result: I'm assuming you want me to sort or categorize different concepts related to the universe and multiverse (a collection of universes) in a consecutive series. Here is one possible way to do it using variant number 1:

1. **Physical Properties of the Universe**: This category includes fundamental properties of our universe such as its age, size, shape, composition, and laws of physics.
2. **Cosmological Models**: These are theoretical frameworks that describe the evolution and structure of the universe, including the Big Bang model, inflationary theory, dark matter, and dark energy.
3. **Multiverse Theories**: This category includes theories that propose the existence of multiple universes or dimensions beyond our own, such as the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, string theory, and brane cosmology.
4. **Simulation Hypothesis**: This is the idea that our universe is a computer simulation created by advanced civilizations in a higher-level universe.
5. **Consciousness and the Universe**: This category explores the relationship between consciousness and the universe, including panpsychism (the view that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of all matter), the simulation hypothesis, and the idea of a universal mind or consciousness.
6. **Spiritual and Metaphysical Concepts**: These are concepts related to religion, spirituality, and metaphysics, such as the concept of God, souls, reincarnation, karma, and higher dimensions beyond our physical universe.
7. **Science Fiction and Pop Culture**: This category includes fictional depictions of universes and multiverses in movies, TV shows, books, comics, and video games.
