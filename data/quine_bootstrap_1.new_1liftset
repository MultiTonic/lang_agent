 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here is a possible way to lift a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 1:

1. Set of all physical objects in the universe, including galaxies, stars, planets, and all forms of matter and energy. This set can be represented as U.
2. Set of all possible properties or attributes that can be observed or measured in the universe, such as mass, temperature, velocity, and so on. This set can be represented as P.
3. Set of all mathematical structures that can be used to describe and model the behavior of physical objects and properties in the universe. This set can be represented as M.
4. Set of all possible universes or "multiverses" that could exist, each with its own set of physical objects, properties, and mathematical structures. This set can be represented as U'.
5. Set of all possible ways in which the elements of U' can be arranged or configured to form a universe. This set can be represented as C.
6. Set of all possible rules or laws that govern the behavior of physical objects and properties within each universe in U'. This set can be represented as L.
7. Set of all possible interpretations or meanings that can be assigned to the elements and relationships within each mathematical structure in M, and to the configurations of physical objects and properties within each universe in U'. This set can be represented as I.

Using this ordering, we can describe the universe as the set U of physical objects, with their properties P and the mathematical structures M that model them, subject to the rules L and interpreted through the lens of I. The universe of universes U' would then consist of all possible configurations C of physical objects and properties within each universe, also subject to L and interpreted through I.
