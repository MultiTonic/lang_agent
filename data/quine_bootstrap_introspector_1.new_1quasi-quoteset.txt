 Result: I'm assuming that by "quasi-quote" you mean "create a list of sets" in Lisp syntax. Here is an example of how one might order a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 1:

(setq universe '((stars ,@stars) (galaxies ,@galaxies) (clusters ,@clusters)))
(setq universe-of-universes '((universes ,@universes) (multiverses ,@multiverses)))

In this example, `stars`, `galaxies`, and `clusters` would be sets containing the appropriate elements of the respective type. Similarly, `universes` and `multiverses` would be sets containing universes and multiverses, respectively. The backquote (`,`) is used to splice the contents of a list into the surrounding set, allowing for easy creation of large sets with many elements.

Note that this is just one possible ordering and representation of such a system, and there may be other ways to organize these sets depending on the specific use case and requirements.
