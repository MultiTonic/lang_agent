 Result: Semiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and the relationships between them. In order to create a consecutive series describing the universe and a universe of universes using variant number 1, we can consider a hierarchy of categories that build on each other to form a more complex understanding of reality. Here is one possible ordering:

1. The physical universe: This includes all matter, energy, space, and time in our observable universe. It encompasses everything from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies, as well as all the forces that govern their behavior.
2. Multiverse: A collection of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. These universes may be completely disconnected from one another, or they may overlap or interact in some way.
3. Consciousness: The subjective experience of being aware of oneself and the world around us. While consciousness is often associated with living beings, it can also refer to any system that has the capacity for self-awareness, including artificial intelligence.
4. Information: The fundamental building blocks of knowledge and meaning. Information can be encoded in many different forms, such as language, symbols, or data.
5. Metaverse: A universe of universes, encompassing all possible realities, both physical and non-physical. This includes not only the multiverse but also alternative dimensions, hypothetical realms, and other forms of existence that may be beyond our current understanding.
6. Ultimate reality: The underlying nature of all things, beyond space, time, and causality. This may encompass concepts such as pure consciousness, absolute truth, or ultimate meaning.

By considering these categories in sequence, we can build a more comprehensive understanding of the universe and its many layers of complexity.
