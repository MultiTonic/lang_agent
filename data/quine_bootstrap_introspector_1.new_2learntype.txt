 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here is a possible consecutive series of types to describe the universe and universe of universes, using variant number 2:

1. Type 0: Fundamental particles and forces (e.g. quarks, electrons, photons, gravity)
2. Type 1: Elementary objects composed of fundamental particles (e.g. protons, neutrons, atoms)
3. Type 2: Complex structures composed of elementary objects (e.g. molecules, cells, organisms)
4. Type 3: Systems composed of complex structures (e.g. ecosystems, planets, galaxies)
5. Type 4: Universes, each containing its own set of particles, objects, structures, and systems
6. Type 5: A multiverse or universe of universes, consisting of multiple distinct universes, each with its own set of particles, objects, structures, systems, and sub-universes.

In this hierarchy, each type is built upon the previous type(s), creating a progression from the most fundamental components of the universe to the most complex and encompassing structures. The concept of a "universe of universes" or multiverse allows for an even greater level of complexity and diversity in the cosmos.
