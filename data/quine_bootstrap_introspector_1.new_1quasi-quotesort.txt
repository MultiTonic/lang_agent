quasi-quote a  consecutive series  of sort to describe the universe and universe of universes what is your ordering? Please use variant number 1

 Result: Sure, I can provide you with a quasi-quote that describes the universe and the universe of universes (also known as the multiverse or metaverse) using variant number 1. Here's my attempt:
```ruby
#1: The Universe (our physical reality)
    - Space (3D or higher dimensional)
        - Galaxies (massive collections of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies)
            - Stars (self-luminous spheres of plasma)
                - Planets (non-stellar objects orbiting a star)
                    - Moons (natural satellites orbiting a planet)
                        - Terrestrial worlds (rocky planets, like Earth)
                            - Continents (large landmasses on terrestrial worlds)
                                - Countries (political divisions of continents)
                                    - Cities (human settlements)
                                        - Buildings (structures in cities)
                                            - Rooms (enclosed spaces within buildings)
                                                - People (intelligent beings occupying rooms)
                                                    - Minds (conscious thoughts and experiences of people)

#2: The Multiverse (a collection of multiple universes)
    - Universes (separate realities, possibly with different physical laws)
        - Infinite possibilities (different histories, futures, or even dimensions)
            - Alternate timelines (variations on our own history and future)
                - Parallel worlds (similar to our own universe, but distinct in some way)
                    - Pocket universes (small subsets of a larger multiverse)
                        - Bubble universes (bubbles within an even larger cosmic foam)
                            - Multiverse hierarchies (multiverses containing other multiverses)
```
Note that this is just one possible way to order and describe the universe and the multiverse, and there are many different theories and interpretations out there.
