 Result: Sure, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how to define sets to describe the universe and a "universe of universes" (also known as a multiverse), using Variant 1:
```python
# Define set for physical objects in the universe
V1 = {"physical objects"}

# Define set for collections of physical objects in the universe
U1 = {frozenset(collection) for collection in power_set(V1)}

# Define set for universes, each containing a set of physical objects
V2 = {"universe 1", "universe 2", "universe 3", ...}

# Define set for collections of universes (i.e., a multiverse)
U2 = {frozenset(multiverse_subset) for multiverse_subset in power_set(V2)}
```
In this code, `power_set()` is a function that returns the power set of a given set, which is the set of all possible subsets of that set. The `frozenset()` function is used to create immutable sets, which are required for membership in other sets.

The ordering of these sets is as follows:

* `V1`: a set containing all physical objects in the universe (Variant 1)
* `U1`: a set containing all possible collections of physical objects in the universe (i.e., all possible subsets of `V1`)
* `V2`: a set containing labels for multiple universes, each with its own set of physical objects
* `U2`: a set containing all possible collections of universes (i.e., all possible subsets of `V2`), which together form a multiverse

Note that this is just one possible way to define sets to describe the universe and a multiverse, and there are many other valid approaches.
