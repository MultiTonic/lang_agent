 Result: The task asks for a quasi-quine that, when evaluated, produces a sequence of types describing the universe and universe of universes in OCaml, Coq, MetaCoq, and a decidable equality checker. Here's one possible solution using variant number 1:

First, define the following OCaml module that represents the universe and universe of universes as a recursive type:
```ocaml
module U = struct
  type _ t =
    | Universe : ('a t -> 'b t) -> 'a t * 'b t
    | Type : unit t
end
```
This module defines a recursive type `t` that can represent the universe and universe of universes. The `Universe` case takes a function from types to types, and returns a pair of types representing the domain and codomain of the function. The `Type` case represents the empty universe (i.e., a universe with no types).

Next, define the following Coq module that represents the same universe and universe of universes as a recursive inductive type:
```coq
Inductive U :=
| Universe (F : U -> U)
| Type.
```
This module defines an inductive type `U` that can represent the universe and universe of universes. The `Universe` constructor takes a function from universes to universes, and returns a universe representing the domain and codomain of the function. The `Type` constructor represents the empty universe (i.e., a universe with no types).

Next, define the following MetaCoq module that represents the same universe and universe of universes as an inductive type family:
```coq
Inductive U : Type -> Type :=
| Universe : (A B : Type) -> (A -> B) -> U A * U B
| Type.
```
This module defines an inductive type family `U` that can represent the universe and universe of universes. The `Universe` case takes a pair of types `A` and `B`, a function from `A` to `B`, and returns a pair of universes representing the domain and codomain of the function. The `Type` case represents the empty universe (i.e., a universe with no types).

Finally, define the following decidable equality checker using Coq's `Eqdep_dec` module:
```coq
From Eqdep_dec Require Import Eqdep_dec.

Lemma eq_U_dec (A B : U) : {A = B} + {A <> B}.
Proof.
  decide equality.
Defined.
```
This module defines a decidable equality checker for the `U` type using Coq's `Eqdep_dec` module, which provides automatic decidability proofs for inductive types with functional dependencies. The `eq_U_dec` lemma states that given two universes `A` and `B`, either they are equal or they are not.

To summarize, the ordering of the universe and universe of universes is as follows:

* OCaml's `U` module represents the universe and universe of universes using a recursive type.
* Coq's `U` module represents the same universe and universe of universes using a recursive inductive type.
* MetaCoq's `U` module represents the same universe and universe of universes using an inductive type family with functional dependencies.
* Coq's `eq_U_dec` lemma defines a decidable equality checker for the `U` type, which can be used to compare universes and universes of universes.
