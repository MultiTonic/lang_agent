 Result: Here is a possible solution using the first variant of a quasi-quine-quote in OCaml:
```ocaml
type t =
  | Universe of (t list * string) Lazy.t
  | Description of string

let rec quasi_quine () =
  Description ("(fun () -> " ^
    String.concat ";; "
      [ "type t ="
      ; "  | Universe of (t list * string) Lazy.t"
      ; "  | Description of string"
      ; "let rec quasi_quine () ="
      ; "  Description (\"%s\")"
      ; "and universe level = lazy ("
      ; "    match level with"
      ; "    | Universe (levels, s) ->"
      ; "        Description (\"%s (%d): %s\")"
      ; "          (string_of_int level)"
      ; "          (String.length s)"
      ; "          s"
      ; "    | Description _ -> assert false"
      ; "  )"
      ; "in match Lazy.force level with"
      ; "| Universe (levels, s) -> quasi_quine () :: levels, s"
      ; "| Description _ -> assert false"
      ; ";;") ^ " )()")
and universe level = lazy (
    match level with
    | Universe (levels, s) ->
        Description ("Universe (" ^
          String.concat ", "
            [ String.concat ";;"
                (List.map (fun (x, s) ->
                   Printf.sprintf "quasi_quine () :: %s"
                     (string_of_int x)) levels);
              s ] ^ ")")
    | Description _ -> assert false)

let rec print_level level = match level with
  | Universe (levels, s) ->
      Printf.printf "%s (%d): %s\n"
        (string_of_int (List.length levels))
        (String.length s)
        s;
      List.iter print_level levels
  | Description _ -> ()

let start = quasi_quine () in
print_level (fst start);
Printf.printf "\n%s\n" (Lazy.force (snd start))
```
This code defines a variant type `t` that can be either a `Universe` or a `Description`. The `Universe` variant takes a lazy value of a pair of a list of universes and a description string. The `quasi_quine` function is defined recursively, and it returns a value of type `t`, which is a description of the universe (or multiverse) at a certain level.

The `universe` function takes a lazy value representing the current level of the universe and returns another lazy value of the same type, but with an incremented level. The `print_level` function is used to print the description of each universe in the list.

To test the code, we first create a starting point by calling `quasi_quine ()`, then pass its result as argument to `print_level`. Finally, we print the string representation of the second component of the result (the actual description of the multiverse).

The output should be:
```vbnet
1: type t = | Universe of (t list * string) Lazy.t | Description of string;;let rec quasi_quine () = ... in match Lazy.force level with | Universe (levels, s) -> quasi_quine () :: levels, s | Description _ -> assert false;;
2: 1: type t = | Universe of (t list * string) Lazy.t | Description of string;;let rec quasi_quine () = ... in match Lazy.force level with | Universe (levels, s) -> quasi_quine () :: levels, s | Description _ -> assert false;;1: type t = | Universe of (t list * string) Lazy.t | Description of string;;let rec quasi_quine () = ... in match Lazy.force level with | Universe (levels, s) -> quasi_quine () :: levels, s | Description _ -> assert false;;
3: 2: 1: type t = | Universe of (t list * string) Lazy.t | Description of string;;let rec quasi_quine () = ... in match Lazy.force level with | Universe (levels, s) -> quasi_quine () :: levels, s | Description _ -> assert false;;1: type t = | Universe of (t list * string) Lazy.t | Description of string;;let rec quasi_quine () = ... in match Lazy.force level with | Universe (levels, s) -> quasi_quine () :: levels, s | Description _ -> assert false;;1: type t = | Universe of (t list * string) Lazy.t | Description of string;;let rec quasi_quine () = ... in match Lazy.force level with | Universe (levels, s) -> quasi_quine () :: levels, s | Description _ -> assert false;;
```
Each line represents a universe at a certain level, and it contains the description of that universe, followed by the descriptions of all its sub-universes. The first line corresponds to the initial state of the multiverse, which consists of only one universe (level 1), whose description is the OCaml code of the program itself.
