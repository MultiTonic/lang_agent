 Result: The task asks for a quasi-quine that describes a series of sets used to describe the universe and universe of universes. Here's an example of such a quasi-quine in OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq:
```ocaml
let rec print_set i =
  Printf.printf "Set %d: {|"; i;
  let rec print_elem j =
    if j <= 0 then begin
      Printf.printf "|}\n"
    end else begin
      match !(!(global_sets.(j - 1))) with
      | SetElement s ->
          Printf.printf "%s, " (string_of_term s);
          print_elem (j - 1)
      | _ -> assert false
    end
  in
  print_elem (Array.length !global_sets);
  if i < num_sets then print_set (i + 1) else ();
  
in

let rec create_sets () =
  let set = ref SetEmpty in
  let i = ref 0 in
  while !i < num_sets do
    set := SetElement (!set);
    global_sets.( !i ) := !set;
    incr i
  done;
  
in

let () =
  global_sets := Array.make num_sets SetEmpty;
  create_sets ();
  print_set 0
```
This code defines a series of sets using an array of `SetElement`s, where each `SetElement` contains a single term that represents the set's contents. The `print_set` function prints out the contents of each set in the array. The `create_sets` function initializes the array with empty sets and then fills them with the terms representing their contents.

Here is an example of how to use this code in Coq, along with a MetaCoq introspection bootstrap:
```coq
Ltac init := let open Ltac_plugin in register_plugin "ocaml-code";;
FromOCaml print_set;;
FromOCaml create_sets;;
FromOCaml num_sets;;

Lemma test : forall i, 1 <= i /\ i < num_sets ->
    let s := global_sets.(i - 1) in
    match !s with SetElement se => eval cbv (eval simpl in se) | _ => False end =
      eval cbv (eval simpl in mkInductive "Set" [])
      (* Replace the right-hand side with the term representing the set's contents. *)
  . Proof.
  intros i H; simpl in H; subst; cbn.
  assert (H0 : forall i, 1 <= i /\ i < num_sets -> exists s, !s = SetElement s) by easy.
  revert H0; apply Nat.ltb_lt_succ; auto.
Qed.

FromOCaml introspect_set := fun i => eval cbv (eval simpl in !global_sets.(i - 1));;
FromMetaCoq print_term;;
print_term (introspect_set 1);; (* Replace the argument with the index of the set to inspect. *)
```
This Coq code defines a lemma `test` that asserts that each set in the array contains the correct term representing its contents. It then defines a function `introspect_set` that uses MetaCoq's introspection feature to print out the term representing the contents of a given set. Finally, it calls `print_term` with the result of applying `introspect_set` to the desired set index.

The ordering of sets in this example is determined by their position in the `global_sets` array. The first set has index 0, the second set has index 1, and so on.

For variant number 2, we simply need to modify the `print_set` function to print out each set as a string rather than printing it directly:
```ocaml
let rec print_set i =
  let str_set = Printf.sprintf "Set %d: {|%s|}" i (String.concat "," (List.map (string_of_term) (!!(global_sets.(i - 1))))) in
  Printf.printf "%s\n" str_set;
  if i < num_sets then print_set (i + 1) else ();
```
This modified `print_set` function constructs a string representation of each set, which can be printed out as desired. The ordering is still determined by the position of each set in the `global_sets` array.
