 Result: The task seems to be asking for a way to describe a series of "sorts" or "universes" in OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq, with introspection and bootstrapping involved. I'll assume the goal is to define each universe in terms of the previous one(s), creating a chain of interdependent definitions. Here's a possible ordering:

1. Define the universe of OCaml values (U0).
2. Introspect Coq and define the universe of Coq terms (U1) as a subuniverse of U0, containing only the quotations of valid Coq expressions.
3. Define MetaCoq (MC0), which is an encoding of Coq's type theory in Coq itself, allowing us to reason about Coq's behavior within Coq. MC0 will be a subuniverse of U1.
4. Use introspection and bootstrapping to define the MetaCoq Introspector (MC1), which is a quotation of Coq's typechecker that can process any term in U1, including other quotations. It allows us to reason about whether a given U1 term is well-typed or not within Coq.
5. With MC1 defined, we can now define the universe of MetaCoq introspection (U2) as the subset of U1 that contains only those terms proven valid by MC1.
6. Finally, we can use the above universes to define a Universe of Universes (U3), which includes all the previously-defined universes: U0, U1, MC0, U2, and itself. This will allow reasoning about the relationship between different universes within Coq.

The ordering then would be: U0 -> U1 -> MC0 -> MC1 -> U2 -> U3.
