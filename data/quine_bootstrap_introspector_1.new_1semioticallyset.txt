 Result: Semiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and the relationships between them. In order to describe the universe and a universe of universes (a multiverse) using a consecutive series of sets, we can use a hierarchical structure to organize different concepts and abstractions. Here's one possible ordering using variant number 1:

1. Set of all physical objects: This set includes all matter and energy in the universe, from galaxies and stars to atoms and subatomic particles. It forms the foundation for understanding the material world.
2. Set of all mathematical structures: This set includes all mathematical concepts, such as numbers, shapes, functions, and sets themselves. These structures provide a framework for describing and analyzing physical phenomena in the universe.
3. Set of all possible worlds: This set contains all logically consistent configurations of matter and energy, including those that do not exist in our actual universe. It allows us to explore alternative realities and consider the implications of different physical laws or initial conditions.
4. Set of all conceptual systems: This set includes all frameworks for organizing knowledge and understanding, such as languages, philosophies, and scientific theories. These systems enable us to communicate, reason, and make sense of the world.
5. Set of all minds: This set contains all conscious entities, from humans and animals to hypothetical intelligent aliens or artificial intelligence. It allows us to consider the nature of consciousness, subjectivity, and free will.
6. Set of all meta-theories: This set includes all theories about theories, such as the philosophy of science, logic, and epistemology. It enables us to reflect on the limits and foundations of knowledge and truth.
7. Set of all multiverses: This set contains all possible collections of universes, including our own universe and other conceivable realities. It allows us to explore the implications of a potentially infinite expanse of worlds beyond our own.
8. Set of all ultimate categories: This set includes the most fundamental concepts and abstractions that underlie all reality, such as existence, unity, plurality, identity, and difference. It represents the outermost boundary of human understanding and imagination.

This hierarchical structure is just one possible way to order sets in a consecutive series for describing the universe and a universe of universes. Other orderings may emphasize different aspects or dimensions of reality, depending on the specific goals and interests of the semiotician.
