We are building a proof and prompt software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Launch doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: Ast connected with Ast . We want to generate and test and prove the results. Trace how the requirements are reflected in the prompt, the test and the proof. What is your response? Please generate prompt/proof/test variant array of size 4
#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Sure, I understand that you want me to create four variants of prompts, tests, and proofs using the given context in a creative way. Here are the variants:

Prompt Variant 1:
"Please launch an introspection on the executable named 'ast\_generator' which is connected to the abstract syntax tree (Ast) of OCaml code. We want to generate and test this software component, and prove its correctness using Coq."

Test Variant 1:
```scss
let ast_generator = Executable.run "ast_generator" in
match ast_generator with
| Error e -> failwith ("Error running executable: " ^ e)
| Ok ast_gen ->
  let ocaml_code = "(* OCaml code to be parsed *)" in
  let parsed_ast = Ast.parse ocaml_code in
  let generated_ast = Ast.generate parsed_ast in
  Alcotest.(check bool) "Generated AST is equal to parsed AST" true (Ast.equal parsed_ast generated_ast)
```
Coq Proof Variant 1:
```scss
Lemma ast_generator_correct : forall ocaml_code, Parsed_AST.t ocaml_code = Generated_AST.t (Ast_Generator.run (Parsed_AST.to_string ocaml_code)).
Proof.
  intros ocaml_code.
  unfold Parsed_AST.t, Generated_AST.t, Ast_Generator.run.
  rewrite <- (Ast_Generator.equal_by_conversion (fun _ -> id)).
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.
```
Prompt Variant 2:
"Could you launch an introspection on the 'coq\_proof\_engine' program, which is connected to the Ast of Coq proofs? We want to generate this tool and test its functionality, as well as prove that it adheres to our specifications."

Test Variant 2:
```python
let coq_proof_engine = Executable.run "coq_proof_engine" in
match coq_proof_engine with
| Error e -> failwith ("Error running executable: " ^ e)
| Ok coq_pe ->
  let coq_file = "(* Coq proof to be checked *)" in
  let verified_proof = Coq_Proof_Engine.verify coq_file in
  Alcotest.(check bool) "Verified Coq proof is valid" true verified_proof
```
Coq Proof Variant 2:
```vbnet
Lemma coq_proof_engine_correct : forall coq_proof, Coq_Proof.t (open_channel coq_proof) = Coq_Proof_Engine.verify_result (Coq_Proof_Engine.run (input_string (open_channel coq_proof))).
Proof.
  intros coq_proof.
  unfold Coq_Proof.t, Coq_Proof_Engine.verify_result, Coq_Proof_Engine.run.
  rewrite <- (Coq_Proof_Engine.equal_by_conversion (fun _ -> id)).
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.
```
Prompt Variant 3:
"We need to launch an introspection on the 'large_language_model' application, which operates with Ast of programming languages. Our goal is to generate this software and test its performance, as well as formally verify its accuracy using Coq."

Test Variant 3:
```python
let large_language_model = Executable.run "large_language_model" in
match large_language_model with
| Error e -> failwith ("Error running executable: " ^ e)
| Ok llm ->
  let code_snippet = "(* Code snippet to be analyzed *)" in
  let analysis_results = Large_Language_Model.analyze llm code_snippet in
  Alcotest.(check bool) "Analysis results are correct" true (Some (Analysis.equal_by_conversion (fun _ -> id))) analysis_results
```
Coq Proof Variant 3:
```ocaml
Lemma large_language_model_correct : forall code_snippet, Large_Language_Model.t llm (input_string code_snippet) = Some (Analysis.t (fun _ -> id)) (Large_Language_Model.analyze_result (Large_Language_Model.run (input_string code_snippet))).
Proof.
  intros code_snippet.
  unfold Large_Language_Model.t, Large_Language_Model.analyze_result, Large_Language_Model.run.
  rewrite <- (Large_Language_Model.equal_by_conversion (fun _ -> id)).
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.
```
Prompt Variant 4:
"Please launch an introspection on the 'adaptive_language_agent' service, which is linked to the Ast of both OCaml and Coq codes. Our objective is to generate this software and evaluate its reliability through tests, as well as formally validate its design using Coq."

Test Variant 4:
```python
let adaptive_language_agent = Executable.run "adaptive_language_agent" in
match adaptive_language_agent with
| Error e -> failwith ("Error running executable: " ^ e)
| Ok ala ->
  let ocaml_code = "(* OCaml code to be parsed and processed *)" in
```
