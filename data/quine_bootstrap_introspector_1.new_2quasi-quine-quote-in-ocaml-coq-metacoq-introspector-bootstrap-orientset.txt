 Result: I am not able to fully understand or generate code in OCaml, Coq, or MetaCoq. However, I can provide a general answer to your question about ordering for a "consecutive series of sets" describing the universe and universe of universes.

In set theory, there are different ways to describe a hierarchy of universes. One common approach is to use a sequence of sets or universes (V\_n) indexed by ordinal numbers (n). The ordering would be based on these ordinal indices. For the specific variant you mentioned (number 2), I will present a simplified version of a set-theoretic hierarchy using the von Neumann universe construction with two types:

1. **U** (Universe): A type representing the Universe of Sets, which contains all sets in the hierarchy.
2. **U\_of\_U** (Universe of Universes): A type representing the Universe of Universes, which contains all universes (sets of sets) in the hierarchy.

To create a consecutive series of universes and universe of universes:

1. Create an empty set, V\_0, as the base for the construction.
2. Define a function that takes a universe (set of sets) and forms a new universe by taking its power set (set of all subsets), then adding V\_n+1 to V\_n.
3. Iterate this function through all ordinal numbers up to some limit, creating the sequence V\_0, V\_1, V\_2, ...
4. Define U as the union of all sets in the sequence (V\_n).
5. Create an empty set for the Universe of Universes, W\_0.
6. Define a function that takes a Universe of Universes and forms a new one by taking its power set, then adding U to W\_n.
7. Iterate this function through all ordinal numbers up to some limit, creating the sequence W\_0, W\_1, W\_2, ...
8. Define U\_of\_U as the union of all sets in the sequence (W\_n).

This is a simplified version of a set-theoretic hierarchy and may not be suitable for formalization in Coq or MetaCoq, which typically use type theory rather than set theory.
