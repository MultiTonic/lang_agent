We are building a software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Imagine doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: company connected with list . What is your response? Please generate variant array of size 1
#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Sure, I'll do my best to creatively interpret the context and generate a variant array of size 1.

Context:
Verb: Imagine doing introspect
Type Name: executable with an executable
Place: Company connected with list

Response:

type exec_kind =
| OCaml of string
| Coq of string

type exec_list =
| Nil
| Cons of exec_kind * exec_list

(* Introspecting the company's software generator, we can see that it generates two kinds of executables: OCaml and Coq.
Each executable is represented as a string containing its name and any necessary arguments.
An exec_list is a linked list of these kind-name pairs, allowing for easy iteration over the generated executables. *)

let exec_array : exec_kind array = [| OCaml "ocaml_executable"; Coq "coq_proof" |]

(* The exec_array type is a variant array with two elements: one of kind OCaml, and one of kind Coq.
This represents the company's software generator's output in a compact and easily-accessible form. *)
