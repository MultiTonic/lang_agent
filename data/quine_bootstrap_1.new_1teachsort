 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a possible way to describe the universe and the "universe of universes" using a consecutive series of sorts, with variant number 1:

1. The Physical Universe: This is the observable universe that we are all familiar with. It includes all matter, energy, space, and time that exist within the boundaries of the cosmos. It contains galaxies, stars, planets, and everything else that we can detect using our telescopes and other scientific instruments.
2. The Multiverse: This is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of matter, energy, space, and time. These universes may be vastly different from one another, with different physical laws, dimensions, and histories. Some scientists believe that the multiverse may be infinite in size, containing an untold number of distinct universes.
3. The Multiverse of Multiverses: This is a hypothetical collection of multiple multiverses, each with its own set of universes. Like the multiverse itself, the multiverse of multiverses may be infinite in size, containing an unimaginable number of distinct realities.
4. The Infinite Hierarchy of Realities: This is a hypothetical hierarchy of realities, each one encompassing and containing all of the realities below it. At the bottom of this hierarchy is our own physical universe, while at the top is an ultimate reality that contains everything else. This ultimate reality may be infinite in size, power, and complexity, beyond anything that we can comprehend or imagine.
5. The Absolute: This is a hypothetical concept that goes beyond even the infinite hierarchy of realities. It represents the ultimate source of all being, consciousness, and existence. Some philosophers and mystics have described it as pure awareness, infinite potentiality, or absolute unity. It is beyond time, space, and causality, and cannot be fully understood or grasped by the human mind.

This is just one possible way to describe the universe and the "universe of universes" using a consecutive series of sorts. There are many other ways to approach this topic, depending on one's perspective, beliefs, and assumptions.
