 Result: Sure, I can help you splice a consecutive series of sentences to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 1. Here's an example ordering:

1. The universe is everything that exists physically, including all matter, energy, space, and time.
2. It is believed to have started with the Big Bang, around 13.8 billion years ago.
3. The universe is constantly expanding and cooling down.
4. Galaxies, clusters of stars, gas, and dust, are the largest structures in the universe.
5. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, contains hundreds of billions of stars, including our Sun.
6. A universe of universes, also known as a multiverse, is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes that together comprise everything that exists.
7. Each universe in a multiverse could have its own set of matter, energy, space, and time, possibly with different physical laws.
8. The existence of a multiverse is still a topic of debate among scientists, but some theories suggest it as a possible explanation for certain phenomena.
9. If a multiverse exists, it could be infinite in size and contain an infinite number of universes, each with its own characteristics and properties.
10. The concept of a multiverse raises interesting questions about the nature of reality and our place in the grand scheme of things.
