 Result: Variant 1: Quasi-Quine-Quote

"A quasi-quine-quote is a fixed sequence of characters that, when interpreted as a program in a given programming language, outputs a description of the universe and the universe of universes. The ordering of this consecutive series of types is as follows:

1. A string literal containing a description of the physical universe, including all known laws of physics, constants, particles, and interactions. This description should be detailed enough to allow for accurate simulations but concise enough to fit within the limitations of the programming language.
2. A string literal containing a description of the multiverse, or the collection of all possible universes, including those that are physically impossible in our universe. This description should include a discussion of the various types of universes, such as those with different numbers of dimensions, different fundamental constants, and different physical laws.
3. A series of print statements that output the contents of the two string literals described above. These statements should be written in a programming language that is capable of producing accurate simulations of the universe and multiverse descriptions.
4. The final character of the quasi-quine-quote should be a quote character, which closes the opening string literal and indicates the end of the program.

By following this ordering, the quasi-quine-quote will output a detailed description of the universe and multiverse when executed in a suitable programming environment."
