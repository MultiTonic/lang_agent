 Result: In variant number 2, we can describe the universe and the universe of universes (also known as the multiverse) using a hierarchical ordering of types. Here's one possible way to shift a consecutive series of types for this purpose:

1. Subatomic particles: This type includes the basic building blocks of matter, such as quarks, leptons, and bosons. These particles combine to form atoms, which in turn form molecules and larger structures.
2. Atoms: Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons, and they combine to form molecules, which are the basis of all matter in the universe.
3. Stars and planets: Stars are massive, luminous spheres of plasma that produce light and heat through nuclear fusion. They often have planetary systems orbiting around them, which can include rocky planets, gas giants, and other celestial bodies.
4. Galaxies: A galaxy is a large collection of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, contains hundreds of billions of stars, as well as many smaller satellite galaxies.
5. Galaxy clusters: Galaxy clusters are vast collections of galaxies that are held together by gravity. They can contain thousands of individual galaxies, as well as huge amounts of hot gas and dark matter.
6. Universes: A universe is a self-contained region of spacetime that contains all matter, energy, and radiation. Our own universe is just one of many possible universes, which together make up the multiverse.
7. The multiverse: The multiverse is the collection of all possible universes, each with its own set of fields, interactions, and particles. It is the largest and most inclusive type in this hierarchy.

By shifting from subatomic particles to the multiverse, we can describe the universe and the universe of universes using a consistent and logical series of types. This hierarchical ordering can help us better understand the nature of reality and the relationships between different aspects of the cosmos.
