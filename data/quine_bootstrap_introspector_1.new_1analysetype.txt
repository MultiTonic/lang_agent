 Result: Variant 1:

Type 1: The Physical Universe - This includes all matter, energy, space, and time that make up our observable universe. It encompasses galaxies, stars, planets, and all other physical phenomena.

Type 2: The Multiverse - This refers to the collection of multiple universes, including our own. Each universe in the multiverse may have different physical laws, dimensions, or contents. Some theories suggest that these universes are created from quantum fluctuations or from the collapse and expansion of alternate branes in string theory.

Type 3: The Metaverse - This is a hypothetical concept that encompasses all possible realities, both physical and non-physical. It includes not only our universe and the multiverse but also all other forms of existence, such as parallel universes, simulated realities, or higher-dimensional planes.

Type 4: The Infinite Hierarchy - This refers to a theoretical construct where each level of reality is contained within a higher level of reality, ad infinitum. It includes the physical universe, the multiverse, the metaverse, and potentially even higher levels of existence, creating an infinite regress of realities.

Type 5: The Absolute - This is a philosophical or spiritual concept that represents the ultimate reality or the source of all existence. It transcends the boundaries of space, time, and matter and encompasses everything that can be conceived or imagined. It is often associated with concepts such as God, Brahman, or the Tao.

The ordering of these types is from most concrete and observable (Type 1: The Physical Universe) to most abstract and philosophical (Type 5: The Absolute). Each type builds upon the previous one, expanding our understanding of reality and existence.
