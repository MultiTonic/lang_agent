We are building a software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Imagine doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: project connected with project What is your response? Please generate variant array of size 1
#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Sure, I'll do my best to respond creatively while using the given context. Here's a variant array of size 1:

type executable = Executable of string

let exec_variant : executable variant array = [|Executable "ocaml_coq_generator"|]
