 Result: In variant number 2, I will define the universe as a set containing all existing things, and the "universe of universes" as a collection of all possible universes. Here's one way to describe these sets in a consecutive series:

1. The set of all fundamental particles, including quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons.
2. The set of all atoms, which are formed by combining protons, neutrons, and electrons.
3. The set of all molecules, which are formed by combining atoms through chemical reactions.
4. The set of all celestial bodies, including stars, planets, moons, comets, and asteroids.
5. The set of all galaxies, which are collections of stars, gas, and dust bound together by gravity.
6. The set of all clusters and superclusters, which are groups of galaxies.
7. The set of all large-scale structures in the universe, including filaments, walls, and voids.
8. The set of all possible universes, each with its own set of fundamental particles, atoms, molecules, celestial bodies, galaxies, clusters, and large-scale structures. This set is sometimes called the "multiverse" or the "universe of universes".
9. The set of all mathematical structures, including sets, groups, rings, fields, and categories. These structures may exist independently of the physical universe, but they provide a framework for understanding it.
10. The set of all possible conceptual systems, including logic, language, philosophy, and culture. These systems shape our understanding of the universe and its place in the multiverse.
