 Result: For this exercise, let's consider a "universe" to be a complete and self-contained reality, and a "universe of universes" (or "multiverse") to be a collection of such universes. Here is an example of how one might order a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and universe of universes, using variant number 10:

1. The physical universe: This set includes all matter, energy, space, and time that make up our observable universe. It includes galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of physical matter.
2. The biological universe: This set includes all living organisms, from the simplest bacteria to the most complex multicellular life forms. It also includes the ecosystems and habitats that support life.
3. The cognitive universe: This set includes all conscious beings, including humans, animals, and any other entities that have the ability to think, feel, and perceive the world around them.
4. The cultural universe: This set includes all of the shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that make up human culture. It includes languages, religions, arts, sciences, and technologies.
5. The virtual universe: This set includes all computer-generated environments, simulations, and virtual worlds, including video games, virtual reality, and online communities.
6. The possible universe: This set includes all logically possible worlds, including those that are not actualized in our physical universe. It includes alternative histories, parallel universes, and other hypothetical realities.
7. The multiverse: This set includes all of the universes that exist, both actual and possible. It is the collection of all reality, encompassing everything that exists or could exist.
8. The transcendent universe: This set includes all concepts, ideas, and abstractions that transcend the physical universe, such as mathematics, logic, ethics, and aesthetics. It also includes spiritual and mystical experiences that cannot be explained by scientific materialism.
9. The ultimate universe: This set includes the fundamental principles, laws, or properties that underlie all of reality. It is the source or origin of all existence, and may be considered divine, eternal, or infinite.
10. The absolute universe: This set includes the sum total of all being, consciousness, or experience. It is the ultimate unity or wholeness that encompasses all things, and may be considered the ultimate goal or purpose of existence.
