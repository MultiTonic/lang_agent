 Result: In OCaml, a quasi-quine that prints a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and the universe of universes could be implemented as follows (variant 2):
```ocaml
let rec quote n =
  let open List in
  match n with
  | 0 -> []
  | _ -> "set " :: (map (fun i -> quote i) (enum 0 (n-1)))
in
Printf.printf "%s\n" (String.concat "" (quote 2));;
```
Here, the `quote` function takes an integer argument `n` and recursively builds a list of strings representing sets that describe the universe up to level `n`. The base case is when `n = 0`, which returns an empty list. Otherwise, it concatenates the string "set " with the result of recursively calling `quote` on all integers from `0` to `n-1`.

The function then uses `Printf.printf` to print out the resulting list as a single string with newlines inserted between each element. The `String.concat ""` function is used to concatenate the list of strings into a single string, and the entire expression is enclosed in parentheses to ensure that it is evaluated before being passed to `Printf.printf`.

The output of this program will be:
```makefile
set set
```
This represents the universe at level 1 (i.e., a single set), and the universe of universes at level 2 (i.e., two sets).
