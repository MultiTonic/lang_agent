 Result: In variant number 2, we will use a hierarchical structure to describe the universe and the universe of universes (also known as the multiverse). Here's a possible consecutive series of sorts:

1. The Multiverse: This is the collection of all possible universes, including those that do not contain intelligent life or any physical laws at all. It may be infinite in size and complexity.
2. The Observable Universe: This is the portion of the universe that we can actually observe from Earth, using current technology. It includes all matter and energy within a sphere of about 93 billion light-years in diameter.
3. Galaxies: Within the observable universe, there are hundreds of billions of galaxies, each containing millions to trillions of stars. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is just one of these.
4. Stars: Each galaxy contains many stars, which are massive balls of hot gas that emit light and heat through nuclear fusion. Our sun is an example of a star.
5. Planets: Many stars have planets orbiting around them, which are large rocky or gaseous bodies. Earth is an example of a planet.
6. Moons: Some planets have natural satellites, or moons, that orbit around them. Our planet has one moon, which we call the Moon.
7. Atoms: All matter in the universe is made up of tiny particles called atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons.
8. Subatomic Particles: Within atoms, there are even smaller particles called quarks, leptons, and bosons. These particles make up the fundamental building blocks of matter.
9. Energy: In addition to matter, the universe is also filled with energy, which can take many forms, such as light, heat, and electricity.
10. The Unknown: Despite our best efforts, there are still many things about the universe that we do not understand, and may never be able to fully explain. This includes concepts like dark matter, dark energy, and the nature of time itself.

This hierarchical structure is just one possible way to describe the universe and multiverse. There are other ways to categorize and sort these concepts, depending on the context and the specific questions being asked.
