 Result: Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a variant array of size 1 with different treasures from around the world:

[
"The Lost City of Zerzura in Egypt",
"The Treasure of Lima in Peru",
"The Amber Room in Russia",
"The Crown Jewels of India",
"The Hope Diamond in the US",
"The Nazca Lines in Peru",
"The Terracotta Army in China",
"The Holy Grail in Europe",
"The Lost Gold of Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean",
"The Mayan Treasure of Guatemala"
]

You can access the first (and only) element of this array by calling its index, like so:
```lua
treasure = myArray[1]
```
This would return "The Lost City of Zerzura in Egypt" as the treasure.
