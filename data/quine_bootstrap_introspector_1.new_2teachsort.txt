 Result: To describe the universe and a universe of universes, I will use a hierarchical ordering in variant #2. Here is a possible consecutive series of sorts:

1. Fundamental particles: These are the basic building blocks of matter, such as quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons. They are described by the Standard Model of particle physics.
2. Atoms: Fundamental particles combine to form atoms, which are the basic units of matter. Atoms are composed of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons.
3. Molecules: Atoms can combine to form molecules, which are groups of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together. Molecules can be simple or complex, and they can form the basis of many different substances.
4. Cells: Cells are the basic units of life. They are composed of a variety of different organelles, each with a specific function. Cells can be either prokaryotic (without a nucleus) or eukaryotic (with a nucleus).
5. Organisms: Organisms are living beings that consist of one or more cells. They can be unicellular (consisting of a single cell) or multicellular (consisting of many cells). Organisms can be classified into different taxonomic groups, such as kingdoms, phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species.
6. Ecosystems: Ecosystems are communities of organisms that interact with each other and their environment. They can be as small as a pond or as large as a forest.
7. Planets: Planets are celestial bodies that orbit a star. They are composed of solid, liquid, or gaseous material, and they can have a variety of different atmospheres.
8. Stars: Stars are massive, luminous spheres of plasma that generate energy through nuclear fusion. They can be found in galaxies, which are vast collections of stars, gas, and dust.
9. Galaxies: Galaxies are systems of millions or billions of stars, along with gas, dust, and dark matter. They can take a variety of different forms, such as spiral, elliptical, or irregular.
10. Universes: A universe is a collection of galaxies that are bound together by gravity. It is thought that our universe is just one of many universes, collectively known as the multiverse. The multiverse may contain an infinite number of universes, each with its own set of galaxies, stars, and planets.
