 Result: The task asks for a quasi-quine that describes a series of sets used to model universes and universes of universes in OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq. I'll provide an example using ascending order of complexity:

1. OCaml Quasi-Quine: A self-replicating OCaml program that prints its source code when executed.
2. Coq development: A Coq formalization of the OCaml quasi-quine, ensuring it behaves as a quine in Gallina, Coq's language.
3. MetaCoq introspection: Use MetaCoq to reflect on the Coq development and prove that the original OCaml code and its Coq counterpart behave identically.
4. Bootstrapping: Create an executable from the OCaml quasi-quine, compile it to native code, then use the resulting binary to reproduce the initial OCaml source code.
5. Universe and universe of universes sets: Formalize a model for universe and universe of universes sets in Coq, extending the previous work on the quasi-quine.

Here's an outline of how the tasks can be ordered based on the provided variant:

1. OCaml Quasi-Quine: Implement a program that prints its own source code when executed. The following example uses the `Printf` module to print the source code, wrapped in a string literal.

```ocaml
let quasi_quine = "let quasi_quine = %s; Printf.printf %S;" ;;
Printf.printf (quasi_quine ^ quasi_quine)
```

2. Coq development: Create a Coq formalization of the OCaml quine using Gallina, ensuring it behaves as a quine by constructing a proof that they are equal.

```coq
Inductive Quine : string -> Prop := 
| QQ_intro : forall s, Quine (Printf.sprintf "Inductive Quine : string -> Prop :=\n%sQuine %S." s s)
.
Lemma quine_idempotent : forall s, Quine s -> Quine s.
Proof. intros; simpl; reflexivity. Qed.
```

3. MetaCoq introspection: Use MetaCoq to reflect on the Coq development and prove that the original OCaml code and its Coq counterpart behave identically. This step is quite complex and requires deep understanding of both Coq and MetaCoq, so I'll only provide a high-level overview.

4. Bootstrapping: Create an executable from the OCaml quasi-quine, compile it to native code, then use the resulting binary to reproduce the initial OCaml source code. This can be done by wrapping the OCaml code in a `.ml` file and compiling it using `ocamlc`.

5. Universe and universe of universes sets: Formalize a model for universe and universe of universes sets in Coq, extending the previous work on the quasi-quine. This can be done by defining two separate inductive types to represent these hierarchies of sets, along with appropriate consistency properties.
