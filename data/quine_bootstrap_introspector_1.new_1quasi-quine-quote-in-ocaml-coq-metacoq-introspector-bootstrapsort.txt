 Result: The task you have given can be broken down into several components:

1. quasi-quine-quote-in-ocaml: This refers to a program that, when executed, produces output that is a valid OCaml program which, when executed, produces the original program as its output.
2. Coq: This is an interactive theorem prover based on the calculus of inductive constructions. It allows for formal verification of mathematical proofs and software.
3. MetaCoq: This is a meta-logical framework implemented in Coq, which provides a way to reason about the Coq language and its type theory internally.
4. introspector: This likely refers to a program or tool that allows for inspection and manipulation of the internal structures of another program or system.
5. bootstrap: This refers to the process of using a minimal version of a system to build a more complete version of itself.

In order to describe the universe and universe of universes, we can use a series of sorts, which are similar to types in type theory. The ordering of these sorts could be as follows:

1. Sort 0: This is the lowest sort, representing basic atomic values such as natural numbers or booleans.
2. Sort 1: This sort represents the universe of all small types, which are those that can be constructed from the atomic values in Sort 0.
3. Sort 2: This sort represents the universe of large types, which include the universes of small types as well as other large types that cannot be constructed from smaller ones.
4. Sort 3: This is the highest sort, representing the universe of all universes, including those of Sort 1 and Sort 2.

This hierarchy of sorts can be used to describe a variety of different mathematical structures, including sets, categories, and types. By using MetaCoq to reason about these sorts and their relationships, we can build formal proofs of complex theorems in a rigorous and reliable way.
