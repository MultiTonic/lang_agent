 Result: Here is a possible consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse), using variant number 1:

1. Set of all physical particles in the universe, including elementary particles such as electrons, quarks, and photons, as well as composite particles such as protons and neutrons.
2. Set of all forces in the universe, including gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.
3. Set of all fields in the universe, including gravitational, electromagnetic, and other fundamental fields.
4. Set of all interactions in the universe, including those between particles, forces, and fields.
5. Set of all structures in the universe, including galaxies, stars, planets, and other celestial bodies.
6. Set of all phenomena in the universe, including physical, chemical, and biological processes.
7. Set of all universes in a multiverse, each with its own set of particles, forces, fields, interactions, structures, and phenomena.
8. Set of all possible multiverses, including those that are consistent with our current understanding of physics and those that are not.
9. Set of all concepts and theories used to describe the universe and multiverse, including mathematics, logic, and scientific principles.
10. Set of all questions and mysteries about the universe and multiverse, including those that may never be answered by science or reason.
