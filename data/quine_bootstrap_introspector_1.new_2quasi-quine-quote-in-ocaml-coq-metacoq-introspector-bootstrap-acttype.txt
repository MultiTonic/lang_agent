 Result: In this question, you are asking for a way to define a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and universe of universes in OCaml, Coq, MetaCoq, and an introspector bootstrap act. Here's one possible solution using variant number 2:

1. OCaml:
```ocaml
type _ t =
  | Universe : (Type.t -> Type.t) t
  | Universe_of_universes : (Universe.t list -> Universe.t) t

let rec universe x = function
  | [] -> Universe (Type.univ x)
  | univs -> Universe_of_universes (univs :: x)
```
In OCaml, we define a recursive type `t` with two constructors: `Universe` and `Universe_of_universes`. The `Universe` constructor takes a function from types to types, while the `Universe_of_universes` constructor takes a function from lists of universes to universes.

The `universe` function is used to build values of type `t`, taking an argument `x` of type `Type.t -> Type.t` or `Universe.t list -> Universe.t`, and returning a value of type `t`.

2. Coq:
```coq
Inductive t (U : Type -> Type) :=
  | Universe : (forall T, U T -> U T) -> t U
  | Universe_of_universes : (list (t U) -> t U) -> t U.

Fixpoint universe (x : forall T, U T -> U T) (xs : list (t U)) : t U :=
  match xs with
  | [] => Universe (fun T => fun x => x)
  | h :: tl =>
    let uu := universe x tl in
    Universe_of_universes (fun l => match l with
                                   | [] => h
                                   | _ :: _ => uu l
                                end)
```
In Coq, we define an inductive type `t` that takes a universe `U : Type -> Type` as its argument. The two constructors are similar to those in OCaml: `Universe` takes a function from types to types, while `Universe_of_universes` takes a function from lists of universes to universes.

The `universe` function is defined recursively, taking an argument `x` of type `forall T, U T -> U T`, and returning a value of type `t U`. The function takes a list `xs` of values of type `t U`, which represents the universe of universes.

3. MetaCoq:
```coq
Inductive t (U : Universe.U) :=
  | Universe : forall T, (T -> T) -> t U
  | Universe_of_universes : (list (t U) -> t U) -> t U.

Fixpoint universe (x : forall T, T -> T) (xs : list (t U)) : t U :=
  match xs with
  | [] => Universe _ (fun T => fun x => x)
  | h :: tl =>
    let uu := universe x tl in
    Universe_of_universes (fun l => match l with
                                   | [] => h
                                   | _ :: _ => uu l
                                end)
```
MetaCoq is a tool for introspection and meta-programming in Coq. We define an inductive type `t` that takes a universe `U : Universe.U` as its argument. The two constructors are similar to those in OCaml and Coq.

The `universe` function is defined recursively, taking an argument `x` of type `forall T, T -> T`, and returning a value of type `t U`. The function takes a list `xs` of values of type `t U`, which represents the universe of universes.

4. Introspector bootstrap act:
```coq
Definition inspect := fun t : t U => match t with
                                   | Universe _ f => f
                                   | Universe_of_universes f => f
                                 end.
```
The `inspect` function takes a value of type `t U`, and returns the function that is encapsulated in the constructor. This allows us to introspect the universe and universe of universes at runtime.

In conclusion, we have defined a consecutive series of types using variant number 2, with constructors that allow us to describe the universe and universe of universes in OCaml, Coq, MetaCoq, and an introspector bootstrap act. The ordering of the types is as follows:

1. OCaml type `t`
2. Coq inductive type `t (U : Type -> Type)`
3. MetaCoq inductive type `t (U : Universe.U)`
4. Introspector bootstrap act function `inspect`
