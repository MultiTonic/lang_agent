 Result: For variant number 5 in describing the universe and universe of universes, my suggested ordering for the consecutive sets would be as follows:

1. The Physical Universe - This set includes all known physical phenomena, such as galaxies, stars, planets, and other celestial bodies. It encompasses everything that exists within our observable universe.
2. The Multiverse - This set contains all possible universes, including those with different physical laws, dimensions, or configurations of matter and energy. It is a collection of all existing and non-existing universes.
3. The Conscious Universe - This set includes all forms of consciousness, whether human, animal, alien, or artificial. It encompasses the collective experiences, thoughts, emotions, and perceptions that exist within the universe and multiverse.
4. The Mathematical Universe - This set contains all mathematical structures, theories, and concepts that describe the physical universe, the multiverse, and consciousness. It includes everything that can be described mathematically, such as numbers, shapes, functions, and equations.
5. The Ultimate Reality - This set represents the underlying truth or essence of the universe, multiverse, consciousness, and mathematics. It encompasses all possible explanations for why things are the way they are and what lies beyond our current understanding of reality. It may include concepts such as God, higher dimensions, or ultimate truths that cannot be fully grasped by human minds.

This ordering attempts to capture a comprehensive view of the universe and universe of universes while also acknowledging the limitations of human knowledge and perception.
