 Result: I'm afraid there is no consensus on a single "correct" way to sort or organize all the elements of the universe or even a universe of universes, as these concepts are highly complex, abstract, and can be interpreted in many different ways depending on one's perspective.

However, for the sake of illustration, let me offer a possible consecutive series of sorts to describe a simplified version of our physical universe, using Variant Number 1:

1. Fundamental particles (e.g., quarks, leptons)
2. Atomic elements (e.g., hydrogen, helium, carbon)
3. Chemical compounds (e.g., water, DNA, proteins)
4. Complex molecules (e.g., polymers, lipids, carbohydrates)
5. Organelles (e.g., mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum)
6. Cells (e.g., bacteria, yeast, animal and plant cells)
7. Tissues (e.g., muscle, nerve, epithelial)
8. Organs (e.g., heart, brain, liver)
9. Organ systems (e.g., circulatory, nervous, digestive)
10. Individual organisms (e.g., humans, animals, plants)
11. Populations (e.g., species, ecosystems, biomes)
12. Planets (e.g., Earth, Mars, Jupiter)
13. Stars (e.g., Sun, Alpha Centauri, Betelgeuse)
14. Galaxies (e.g., Milky Way, Andromeda, Whirlpool)
15. Clusters of galaxies (e.g., Local Group, Coma Berenices, Virgo)
16. Large-scale structures (e.g., filaments, voids, superclusters)
17. The observable universe (i.e., all matter and energy that we can detect)

As for a "universe of universes" or a multiverse, the possibilities are even more speculative and varied. Here is one possible way to sort different types of universes:

1. Universes with the same fundamental laws as ours (e.g., our universe plus all possible variations)
2. Universes with different fundamental laws (e.g., a universe where gravity doesn't exist, or where there are more than four dimensions)
3. Universes with different topologies (e.g., a universe that is finite but unbounded, like the surface of a sphere)
4. Universes with different dimensionalities (e.g., a two-dimensional universe, like a sheet of paper)
5. Universes with different symmetries (e.g., a universe where time runs backwards, or where left and right are reversed)
6. Virtual universes (e.g., simulations, holograms, mathematical models)
7. Consciousness-only universes (e.g., solipsistic worlds, subjective realities, dreamworlds)
8. Ultimate reality or the "ground of being" (e.g., Brahman, Dharmakaya, the One, the All)

Note that these lists are not exhaustive or definitive, and they are meant only as a starting point for exploring the vast and complex concepts of the universe and the multiverse.
