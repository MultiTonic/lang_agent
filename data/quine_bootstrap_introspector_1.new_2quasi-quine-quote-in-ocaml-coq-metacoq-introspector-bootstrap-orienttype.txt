 Result: In describing a consecutive series of types to represent the universe and universe of universes in OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq, we can follow Variant 2 of the quasi-quine-quote proposal. Here's one possible ordering:

1. `Type0` - the base type representing the first universe (type of small types)
2. `Type1` - the universe containing `Type0`, representing a higher universe (type of large types)
3. `Type (Type1)` - a universe in `Type1`, which contains types representable in `Type1` but not in `Type0`
4. `Type : Type1 -> Type` - a function from universes to their corresponding types, with the type in `Type1`
5. `Types` - an inductive type representing the hierarchy of universes, where each universe contains all smaller universes and their corresponding types:
```ocaml
type Types = Type0 | Type1 : Types -> Types
```
6. `U` - a type abbreviation for the highest universe in `Types`, defined as follows:
```ocaml
type U = Types
```
7. `Universe` - a MetaCoq representation of the universes hierarchy, defined as follows:
```coq
Inductive Universe : Type -> Type :=
| U0 : Universe Type0
| U1 : Universe (Type1)
| UU : forall {i j : Types}, i < j -> Universe (Type j).
```
Here, `Type0`, `Type1`, and `Types` are OCaml types, while `Type` is a MetaCoq function type. The `Universe` type in MetaCoq represents the hierarchy of universes using an inductive type with constructors corresponding to each universe level. The order of the universes in this representation follows the ordering defined in `Types`.

Note that in Coq, we need to define a strict ordering on the universes to avoid inconsistencies. This is done by including the `<` relation in the definition of `Universe`, which states that each universe is strictly smaller than the next one.
