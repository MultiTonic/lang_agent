 Result: It seems like the word "consider" was repeated in your message. The verb "consider" means to think about something carefully, to reflect on it, or to take it into account. For example:

* I will need to consider my options before making a decision.
* She considered his proposal and decided to accept it.
* Let's consider the consequences of our actions.
