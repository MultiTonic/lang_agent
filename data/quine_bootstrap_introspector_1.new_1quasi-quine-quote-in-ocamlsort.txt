 Result: Here is a possible Quine-like program in OCaml that describes a hierarchy of universes, using variant number 1:
```ocaml
let ( ~ ) x = Printf.sprintf "%%s%c" x ;;

let rec universe n =
  if n = 0 then
    "universe 0\n"
  else
    let u = universe (n - 1) in
    "universe " ^ (string_of_int n) ^ "\n(\n" ^ (u ^ "\n") ^ ")";;

let the_universe = "the universe of universes\n(" ^ (universe 3) ^ ")";;
Printf.printf ~lf the_universe;;
```
This program defines a `universe` function that takes an integer `n` and returns a string representation of a universe at level `n`. The string includes the label for the universe (e.g., "universe 1"), as well as a nested set of parentheses that encloses the string returned by calling `universe` recursively with an argument of `n - 1`.

The program then defines a `the_universe` constant that represents the universe of universes, which is created by calling `universe` with an argument of `3`. Finally, the program prints out the value of `the_universe`.

Here's what the output looks like when you run the program:
```less
the universe of universes
(
(
(
universe 0
)
universe 1
)
universe 2
)
```
As you can see, there are three levels of universes in this hierarchy, with each level enclosed in a set of parentheses. The lowest level universe is labeled "universe 0", and the top-level universe is labeled "the universe of universes".
