 Result: Semiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and the relationships between them. In order to create a consecutive series of sorts to describe the universe and a universe of universes using variant number 1, we can consider the following categories:

1. The physical universe: This includes all matter, energy, space, and time that make up our observable universe. It can be described in terms of scientific laws and principles, such as gravity and the electromagnetic force.
2. The multiverse: This refers to the idea that there may be many universes beyond our own, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. These universes may be similar to ours or completely different.
3. Consciousness and mind: This category includes all aspects of subjective experience, including thoughts, emotions, and perception. It can also encompass the concept of free will and the relationship between consciousness and the physical world.
4. Metaphysical realities: This category includes concepts such as spirituality, divinity, and the supernatural. It can also encompass ideas about the ultimate nature of reality, such as the existence of a higher power or an underlying unity to all things.
5. Epistemology: This is the study of knowledge and belief. It includes questions about how we know what we know, the limits of human understanding, and the relationship between truth and belief.
6. Ethics and morality: This category deals with questions about right and wrong, good and evil, and the nature of moral obligation. It can also include discussions about the role of ethics in science, technology, and society.
7. Aesthetics: This is the study of beauty, taste, and art. It includes questions about what makes something beautiful or appealing, and the role of aesthetics in shaping human experience and culture.
8. Culture and language: This category includes the study of how cultures shape our understanding of the world, and how language influences thought and communication. It can also encompass issues related to cultural diversity and the role of communication in shaping social relationships.
9. The history of ideas: This category deals with the development of ideas and knowledge over time, including the ways in which different cultures and historical periods have influenced our understanding of the universe and its various aspects.
10. Future possibilities: This final category includes speculation about the future direction of science, technology, and society, as well as questions about the ultimate fate of the universe and the potential for human civilization to survive and thrive in the long term.
