We are building a prompt software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Launch doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: Ast connected with Ast . What is your response? Please generate prompt variant array of size 4

 Result: Sure, I understand that you want me to create four prompts for a software generator in the context of OCaml, Coq proofs, large language models, a proof engine, and an adaptive language agent architecture. Here are four possible prompts:

1. "Imagine you are a powerful language model integrated with a proof engine. Your task is to help users launch an executable named 'Introspect' using the OCaml language and Coq proofs in an adaptive language agent architecture. Can you generate a prompt for this?"
2. "Suppose you are designing a software generator for OCaml and Coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via an adaptive language agent architecture. Your first task is to help users build an executable file named 'AstConnected' in the Ast environment. Can you come up with a prompt for this?"
3. "Consider that you are developing a software generator that uses OCaml, Coq proofs, and a large language model with a proof engine integrated via an adaptive language agent architecture. You need to generate an executable file called 'IntrospectExecutable'. Can you create a prompt for this?"
4. "Think about a scenario where you are building a software generator that combines OCaml, Coq proofs, a large language model, and a proof engine in an adaptive language agent architecture. Your goal is to help users generate an executable file named 'AstConnected' within the Ast environment. Can you formulate a prompt for this?"

I hope these prompts align with what you had in mind!
