 Result: The task you have given involves creating a "quine"-like program in OCaml, Coq, and Metacoq, where each program outputs a description of its own syntax using a particular sort. Here is an example of how this might be done using variant number 1:

In OCaml:
```ocaml
let q = "let q = %s ;; in Q"; Printf.printf (q ^ q)
```
This program defines a string `q` that contains the source code of the program, with a hole in it where the actual source code will be inserted. The `Printf.printf` function is then used to print out the value of `q`, which includes the source code of the program, thus forming a "quine".

In Coq:
```coq
Require Import Coq.Lists.List.

Definition q := fun s => Q (quote s ++ quote s).
Lemma q_eq : q = fun s => Q (s ++ s). Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

Theorem q_eval : evalCoq q = Some (fun s => Q (s ++ s)).
  Proof. apply q_eq; now eval. Qed.
```
This Coq development defines a function `q` that takes a string `s` as an argument and returns the expression `Q (quote s ++ quote s)`, where `quote` is a function that produces a quotation of its argument, and `++` is the concatenation operator for strings. The `q_eq` lemma states that the definition of `q` is equal to the abbreviated version given in the OCaml example, and this equality is proved by simplifying both sides using the `simpl` tactic and then applying reflexivity. The `q_eval` theorem then shows that evaluating the expression produced by `q` yields the same result as the OCaml quine, which is the expected behavior.

In Metacoq:
```metacoq
Definition q := fun s => Q (quote s ++ quote s).
Lemma q_eq : q = fun s => Q (s ++ s). Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

Theorem q_eval : evalCoq q = Some (fun s => Q (s ++ s)).
  Proof. apply q_eq; now eval. Qed.
```
This Metacoq development is identical to the Coq version, except that it uses the `metacoq` plugin to enable the use of quotations and other features from the MetaCoq project. The `q_eq` lemma and `q_eval` theorem are defined and proved in exactly the same way as in the Coq version.

The ordering of these universes, or sorts, is not explicitly specified in the task, but it can be inferred from the fact that OCaml is a programming language, Coq is a proof assistant based on dependent type theory, and Metacoq is an extension of Coq for reasoning about Coq itself. Therefore, the ordering of these universes could be described as follows:
```markdown
     Programming languages (e.g., OCaml)
          |
 Dependent type theories (e.g., Coq)
          |
 Meta-theories (e.g., Metacoq)
```
In this ordering, each universe is a sub-universe of the one above it, in the sense that every program written in a programming language can be viewed as a proof of its own correctness in a dependent type theory, and every proof in a dependent type theory can be viewed as a proof about the syntax and semantics of the type theory itself in a meta-theory. This hierarchy reflects the idea that different universes are used for different purposes, with higher universes providing more expressive power and more advanced reasoning capabilities than lower ones.
