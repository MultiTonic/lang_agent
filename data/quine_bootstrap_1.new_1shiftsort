 Result: I'm assuming you want me to sort a series of words related to the concept of the universe and multiverse, using variant number 1 of the ordering. Here's one possible arrangement:

1. Universe: a single, vast expanse that contains all known matter, energy, space, and time.
2. Multiverse: a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, including the one we inhabit.
3. Cosmos: a term sometimes used interchangeably with "universe," but also encompassing all existing matter and energy in the observable universe.
4. Metaverse: a theoretical collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual reality.
5. Omniverse: a hypothetical concept that includes every possible universe, including those that cannot be observed or measured.
6. Infinity: a concept that represents an unbounded, endless expanse, which could describe the size or scope of a universe or multiverse.
7. Quantum mechanics: a branch of physics that deals with discrete quantities of energy called quanta at the atomic and subatomic level, which could help explain the behavior of particles in the universe.
8. String theory: a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings, which could provide an explanation for the fundamental forces of nature in the universe.
9. Black hole: a region of space with such strong gravitational effects that nothing can escape from inside it, including light, which could represent a singularity or endpoint in the universe.
10. Big Bang theory: the prevailing cosmological model explaining the existence of our current universe, which suggests that it began as an infinitely dense and hot point nearly 13.8 billion years ago.
