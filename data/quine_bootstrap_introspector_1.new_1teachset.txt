 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here is a possible way to describe the universe and a "universe of universes" using a consecutive series of sets, using Variant 1:

1. The smallest set in this hierarchy is the **set of all fundamental particles**, which includes elements such as quarks, leptons, and bosons. These particles are the building blocks of all matter and energy in the universe.
2. The next set in the hierarchy is the **set of all atoms**, which are formed by combining fundamental particles together in specific configurations. Atoms are the basic units of matter, and they combine to form molecules and larger structures.
3. The **set of all molecules** is the next level up in the hierarchy. Molecules are groups of atoms that are bonded together chemically, and they can be simple or complex in structure.
4. The **set of all celestial bodies** includes objects such as stars, planets, moons, and asteroids. These objects are large enough to be visible in telescopes, and they exist within galaxies and other cosmic structures.
5. The **set of all galaxies** is the next level up in the hierarchy. Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, and dust that are bound together by gravity. They come in many different shapes and sizes, and they can contain millions or billions of individual stars.
6. The **set of all clusters and superclusters** includes large-scale structures such as galaxy clusters and filaments, which are formed by the gravitational attraction of galaxies and other cosmic objects. These structures can span hundreds of millions of light-years across.
7. The **set of all cosmic voids** includes the vast, empty spaces between galaxy clusters and superclusters. These voids are some of the largest structures in the universe, and they contain very little matter or energy.
8. Finally, the **universe of universes**, also known as the "multiverse," is the largest set in this hierarchy. It includes all possible universes, including our own. The multiverse may contain an infinite number of individual universes, each with its own set of fundamental particles, atoms, molecules, celestial bodies, galaxies, clusters, and voids.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
