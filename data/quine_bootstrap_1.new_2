 Result: For variant 2, here's one possible ordering for a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and universe of universes:
1. The physical universe: This set includes all matter, energy, space, and time that exist within our observable universe. It contains galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of observable matter.
2. The multiverse: This set includes all possible universes, including the one we inhabit. It encompasses every conceivable configuration of matter and energy, including those that may not be compatible with our current understanding of physics.
3. The mathematical universe: This set includes all mathematically definable structures, such as sets, numbers, shapes, and equations. It provides a framework for describing and understanding the physical universe and the multiverse.
4. The logical universe: This set includes all possible logical systems and rules of inference. It provides a foundation for mathematics and enables us to reason about the mathematical universe.
5. The conceptual universe: This set includes all concepts, ideas, and abstractions that exist independently of any particular language or culture. It encompasses everything from simple notions like "red" or "round" to complex philosophical constructs like "justice" or "beauty."
6. The universal set: This set includes everything that exists, has ever existed, or will ever exist, including all physical and conceptual entities, as well as any higher-level structures or frameworks that may encompass them. It is the largest possible set, and it cannot be fully described or understood within any particular language or system of thought.

This ordering reflects a hierarchy of sets, with each set providing a broader context for understanding the one below it. However, it's important to note that this is just one possible way to order these sets, and there may be other valid ways to conceptualize the relationships between them.
