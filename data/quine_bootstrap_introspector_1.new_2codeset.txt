 Result: Sure, I can help you with that. Here's an example of how you could define a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes using Variant 2:

1. Define a set for the smallest unit of matter, such as an electron or quark. Let's call this set S0.
2. Define a set for a single atom, which is composed of one or more subatomic particles. Let's call this set S1.
3. Define a set for a molecule, which is composed of one or more atoms. Let's call this set S2.
4. Define a set for a macroscopic object, such as a rock or a tree, which is composed of one or more molecules. Let's call this set S3.
5. Define a set for a planet, which is composed of one or more macroscopic objects. Let's call this set S4.
6. Define a set for a galaxy, which is composed of one or more planets. Let's call this set S5.
7. Define a set for the universe, which is composed of one or more galaxies. Let's call this set U1.
8. Finally, define a set for a universe of universes, also known as a multiverse. This set would contain all possible universes, including U1 and any other universes that may exist. Let's call this set U2.

The ordering for these sets would be S0 < S1 < S2 < S3 < S4 < S5 < U1 < U2. In other words, each set is a subset of the next set in the series, with the exception of the final set U2, which contains all possible universes and cannot be contained by any other set.
