 Result: Sure, I can provide a consecutive series of sorts to describe the universe and a universe of universes (multiverse). Here's one way to do it using Variant Number 1:

1. **Physical Universes**: This sort includes all physical universes that exist or could exist according to our current understanding of physics. It includes our own observable universe, as well as any other universes that might exist outside of our observable horizon.
2. **Multiverse**: This sort includes all possible physical universes, including those that are not consistent with our current understanding of physics. This concept is often used in theoretical physics to explore the consequences of different fundamental theories.
3. **Conscious Universes**: This sort includes any universe that contains conscious beings or experiences. It could include physical universes, simulated universes, or even abstract mathematical structures that contain consciousness.
4. **Simulated Universes**: This sort includes any universe that is simulated within another universe. This could include computer simulations, virtual reality environments, or even more exotic forms of simulation.
5. **Mathematical Universes**: This sort includes any universe that can be described mathematically, including abstract structures like sets, groups, and categories. These universes may not be physically real, but they can still be studied and understood using mathematical tools.
6. **Conceptual Universes**: This sort includes any universe that is created through human thought or imagination, such as fictional universes, dream worlds, or philosophical constructs. These universes may not have a physical or mathematical reality, but they can still have a profound impact on human culture and understanding.
7. **Ultimate Universe**: This sort includes the highest level of reality, encompassing all other universes and providing a unified framework for understanding them. This concept is often used in religious or spiritual traditions to provide a sense of ultimate meaning and purpose.

Of course, this is just one possible way to order these sorts, and there are many other ways to approach the question of how to describe the universe and universes of universes.
