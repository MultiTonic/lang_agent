 Result: The task seems to be asking for a way to describe a series of "universes" or type theories, using OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq. I will provide an ordering of these systems based on their level of abstraction and meta-theoretic strength.

1. OCaml: A general-purpose programming language with its own type system. It is not directly a dependent type theory but can be used to implement one.
2. Coq: A proof assistant based on the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, which is a powerful dependent type theory that includes inductive types and universes.
3. MetaCoq: A meta-theory for Coq implemented within Coq itself, providing tools to introspect and reason about the Coq type theory from inside Coq.
4. Bootstrap Act: A hypothetical system, which I assume is intended to be a self-bootstrapped or self-hosted version of MetaCoq, capable of formally verifying its own meta-theory within itself. This would require the use of some form of impredicative polymorphism and an appropriate universe hierarchy.

In this ordering, each system builds on top of the previous ones by either implementing or reasoning about them. The bootstrapping step at the end (Bootstrap Act) represents a self-contained formalization of the entire series within a single unified framework. This is a highly ambitious goal and remains an active area of research in type theory and proof assistants.
