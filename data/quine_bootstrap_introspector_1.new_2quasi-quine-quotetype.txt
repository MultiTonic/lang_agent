 Result: I'm assuming you're asking for a quasi-quine-quote that describes the concept of a universe and a collection of universes (a multiverse) using variant number 2 of the task. Here's one possible solution:
```python
print("""\
Quasi-quine-quote describing the concept of a universe and a collection of universes (multiverse):

Type 'universe' to mean a complete and self-contained system that is governed by its own set of laws and principles. This can include physical objects, natural phenomena, and abstract concepts.

Type 'multiverse' to refer to the collection or aggregate of all possible universes, including those that are actual, hypothetical, or fictional. The multiverse can be thought of as a space of possibilities or potentialities that encompasses all conceivable realities.

Here is an example of how these types can be used in a sentence:

In some interpretations of quantum mechanics, the universe is described by a wave function that evolves over time according to Schrödinger's equation. The collection of all possible wave functions forms a Hilbert space, which can be thought of as a mathematical representation of the multiverse.

Note: This quasi-quine-quote uses the Python string formatting syntax to include the types 'universe' and 'multiverse' in the output.""")
```
When run, this code prints out the following output:
```vbnet

```
The code includes the types `universe` and `multiverse` in the output by using the Python string formatting syntax (the triple quotes) to embed these types within the string literal. This allows us to use these types as part of the quasi-quine-quote while still satisfying the requirements of the task.
