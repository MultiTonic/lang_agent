We are building a software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Imagine doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: university connected with main memory . What is your response? Please generate variant array of size 1
#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Variant array of size 1:

type executable = {
  name: string;
  verb: string;
  place: string;
  coq_proofs: Proof.t option;
}

let exec = {
  name = "software_generator";
  verb = "imagining";
  place = "university_main_memory_connection";
  coq_proofs = None;
}
