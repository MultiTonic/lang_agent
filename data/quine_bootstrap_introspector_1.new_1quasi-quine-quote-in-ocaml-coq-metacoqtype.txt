 Result: Here is an example of a quasi-quine in OCaml that describes a universe and universe of universes using variant number 1:

type 'a language =
| Var of string
| Abs of string * 'a language
| App of 'a language * 'a language

let rec quasi_quine () : (string language) list =
[
Var "type";
Abs ("self", Abs ("univ0",
App (Var "list",
App (Var "map",
App (Var "fst",
App (Var "fst",
App (Var "snd",
App (Var "Pair", Var "univ0")))))</s>));
Abs ("univ1", Abs ("self1",
App (Var "list",
App (Var "map",
App (Var "fst",
App (Var "fst",
App (Var "snd",
App (Var "Pair", Var "self1")))))</s>));
App (Abs ("x", Abs ("y", App (Var "x", Var "y"))),
App (Var "self", Abs ("univ", univ)))
]

This code defines a datatype 'a language, which can represent variables, abstractions, and applications of languages. The function quasi_quine returns a list of languages that describe the universe of universes. Each universe is represented as an abstraction over its own name ("self" or "self1") and another universe ("univ0" or "univ"). The final line applies the identity function to each universe, effectively embedding all the universes in the outermost universe.

Note that this code uses OCaml's syntax extension for s-expressions (<s>...</s>) to make the code more readable.
