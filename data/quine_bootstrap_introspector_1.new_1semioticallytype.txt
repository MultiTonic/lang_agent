 Result: I am not sure I completely understand your question, but I will do my best to provide a helpful response. It seems like you are asking for a semiotic classification system for describing the universe and the "universe of universes" (which could be interpreted as meaning all possible universes, including both our own universe and hypothetical ones). Here is one way to approach this task using variant number 1:

1. Natural phenomena: This category includes physical objects, processes, and events that exist or occur in the universe without human intervention. Examples might include stars, galaxies, black holes, quasars, supernovae, and so on.
2. Artificial phenomena: This category includes objects, processes, and events that are created or manipulated by humans. Examples might include buildings, machines, vehicles, electronic devices, and so forth.
3. Abstract concepts: This category includes ideas, qualities, and relationships that cannot be directly observed or measured but can be inferred or described. Examples might include numbers, shapes, colors, emotions, beliefs, values, and so on.
4. Meta-level concepts: This category includes concepts that describe or encompass multiple other categories or levels of reality. Examples might include systems, structures, patterns, processes, and so forth.
5. Hypothetical universes: This category includes possible worlds, multiverses, or other conceptual frameworks that extend beyond our own universe. Examples might include parallel universes, alternate timelines, higher-dimensional spaces, and so on.

Of course, there are many other ways to categorize and describe the universe and its potential extensions, but this is one possible semiotic ordering using variant number 1.
