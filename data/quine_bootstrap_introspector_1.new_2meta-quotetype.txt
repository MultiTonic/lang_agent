3. The "infinite complexity" type: This type represents the infinite number of interconnected systems and patterns that make up the universe. It includes everything from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies, and all the laws and principles that govern their behavior.
4. The "endless potentiality" type: This type represents the unlimited possibilities and potentialities that exist within the universe. It encompasses all the potential futures and outcomes that could arise from any given situation or set of circumstances.
5. The "eternal flux" type: This type represents the constant change and evolution that is a fundamental aspect of the universe. It includes the cycles of birth, growth, decay, and death that are seen at all levels of reality, from the smallest particles to the largest structures.
