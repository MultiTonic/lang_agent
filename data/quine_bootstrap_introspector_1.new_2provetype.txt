 Result: In this answer, I will provide a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a "universe of universes" (which I will interpret as a collection of universes) using variant number 2.

1. Type: Physical Object
	* Examples: electrons, quarks, galaxies, planets, etc.
2. Type: System
	* A system is a collection of physical objects that interact with each other in a specific way.
	* Examples: solar systems, galaxies, ecosystems, etc.
3. Type: Universe
	* A universe is a single, consistent system that contains all physical objects and systems. It is the largest self-contained system possible.
4. Type: Multiverse (universe of universes)
	* A multiverse is a collection of universes, each of which is a separate, self-contained system. The universes within a multiverse do not interact with each other in any meaningful way.

This ordering starts with the most fundamental building blocks of the universe (physical objects) and progressively builds up to more complex systems, culminating in a collection of universes (a multiverse). This hierarchy provides a framework for understanding and organizing the various components that make up our reality.
