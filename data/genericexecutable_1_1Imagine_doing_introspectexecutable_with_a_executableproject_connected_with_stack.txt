We are building a software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Imagine doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: project connected with stack . What is your response? Please generate variant array of size 1
#+end_src

 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the context you provided, here's a possible response:

Imagine doing introspect on the executable named "ocaml-coq-software-generator" in our project connected with stack. We can create a variant array of size 1 that represents the different stages of development for this software generator. Here's an example:

type stage =
| Planning
| Design
| Implementation
| Testing
| Deployment

let current\_stage : stage = Imagine doing introspect and determining the current stage of development for our "ocaml-coq-software-generator" executable. The value returned would be one of the above stages, depending on where we are in the project lifecycle.

By using a variant array, we can easily expand or modify the different stages as needed, while still maintaining type safety and ensuring that our language model and proof engine are aligned with the current stage of development.
