 Result: In variant number 1, I will consider the following consecutive series to describe the universe and universe of universes:

1. The Physical Universe: This includes all matter, energy, space, and time that make up our observable universe. It encompasses everything from galaxies, stars, planets, and all forms of known and unknown physical phenomena.

2. The Multiverse (Level 1): This is a collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. These universes are fundamentally different from one another, but they share the same basic building blocks as our universe.

3. The Multiverse (Level 2): This level consists of an infinite number of multiverses, including the Level 1 multiverse. Each multiverse in this level has its own set of physical laws and properties, which may be similar or completely different from one another.

4. The Infinite Expanse: This is a hypothetical concept that describes an infinite expanse of universes, multiverses, and other forms of existence beyond our comprehension. It is a realm of pure potentiality, where anything that can be imagined exists in some form or another.

5. The Absolute: This is the ultimate reality that underlies all existence. It is beyond space, time, and causality, and is often described as pure consciousness or awareness. It is the source of all creation, including the Physical Universe, Multiverses, and the Infinite Expanse.

This ordering attempts to describe the universe and universe of universes in a hierarchical manner, starting from the physical realm and moving towards increasingly abstract and metaphysical concepts. It is important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive and may overlap or interact with one another in complex ways.
