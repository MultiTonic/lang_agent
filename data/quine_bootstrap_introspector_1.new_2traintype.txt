 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here is a possible consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 2:

1. Object - this is the most basic type, which can represent any entity or concept.
2. Physical object - a subset of objects that exist in the physical world and have mass, occupy space, and are subject to the laws of physics.
3. Celestial body - a type of physical object that orbits a star, such as a planet, moon, asteroid, or comet.
4. Galaxy - a massive collection of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, bound together by gravity.
5. Universe - a vast expanse containing all matter and energy, governed by the laws of physics, and possibly infinite in size.
6. Multiverse - a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of galaxies, stars, planets, and other celestial bodies.
7. Infinite multiverse - an even more speculative concept, suggesting that there may be an infinite number of multiverses, each containing an infinite number of universes.

This hierarchy moves from the most general type (object) to more specific types (physical object, celestial body, galaxy, universe), and then to hypothetical concepts that go beyond our current understanding of the cosmos (multiverse, infinite multiverse). It's important to note that these types are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and there may be overlap or intersection between them.
