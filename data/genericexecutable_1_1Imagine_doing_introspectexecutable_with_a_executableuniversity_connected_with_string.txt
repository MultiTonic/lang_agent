We are building a software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Imagine doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: university connected with string . What is your response? Please generate variant array of size 1
#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Variant array of size 1:

type executable =Executable of string

let exec_name =
match Sys.getenv "HOME" with
| home -> Executable (home ^ "/my_ocaml_executable")

let main =
[| exec_name |]
