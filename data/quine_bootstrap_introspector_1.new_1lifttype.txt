 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here is a possible consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse), using Variant Number 1:

1. Type 0: Fundamental particles - These are the basic building blocks of matter, such as quarks, leptons, and bosons. They have no substructure and cannot be further divided.
2. Type 1: Atoms - Atoms are made up of fundamental particles, such as protons, neutrons, and electrons. They can form chemical bonds with other atoms to create molecules.
3. Type 2: Molecules - Molecules are groups of atoms that are chemically bonded together. They can form complex structures, such as proteins, DNA, and RNA.
4. Type 3: Cells - Cells are the basic units of life. They contain organelles, which are specialized structures that carry out specific functions.
5. Type 4: Organisms - Organisms are living beings that consist of one or more cells. They can be unicellular (consisting of a single cell) or multicellular (consisting of many cells).
6. Type 5: Ecosystems - Ecosystems are communities of organisms that interact with each other and their environment. They can include plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms.
7. Type 6: Planets - Planets are large celestial bodies that orbit a star. They have solid surfaces and can support life.
8. Type 7: Stars - Stars are massive, luminous spheres of plasma that emit light and heat. They can form galaxies, which are vast collections of stars, gas, and dust.
9. Type 8: Galaxies - Galaxies are huge systems that contain billions of stars, as well as gas, dust, and dark matter. They can be spiral, elliptical, or irregular in shape.
10. Type 9: Multiverses - Multiverses are collections of universes, each with its own set of planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. The nature and extent of multiverses are still a topic of much debate and speculation among scientists.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
