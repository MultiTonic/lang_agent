 Result: Variant 1:

Type 1: The Physical Universe - This refers to the tangible, observable universe that we inhabit, including all matter, energy, space, and time.

Type 2: The Multiverse - A concept that describes a collection of multiple universes, including our own. These universes may have different physical laws, dimensions, or properties.

Type 3: The Metaverse - This term is often used to describe a hypothetical universe of virtual reality, where digital spaces and simulations can be explored and interacted with by conscious beings.

Type 4: The Omniverse - A theoretical construct that encompasses all possible universes, including those that are physical, virtual, or purely conceptual. This could include everything from the multiverse to the platonic realm of forms.

Type 5: The Infinite Existence - Beyond the omniverse lies the concept of an infinite existence, where all possibilities and potentialities coexist in a timeless, boundless expanse. This is often associated with spiritual or metaphysical concepts of ultimate reality.

The ordering I would suggest for this series is from most concrete and tangible (the physical universe) to most abstract and universal (the infinite existence).
