 Result: Sure, here's one possible way to describe the universe and a "universe of universes" using a series of sorts, in variant number 1:

1. The Physical Universe: This is the observable universe that we inhabit, consisting of galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy. It is governed by the laws of physics and is constantly expanding.
2. The Multiverse: This concept refers to a collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. Some multiverse theories propose that these universes are completely separate and disconnected from one another, while others suggest that they may overlap or interact in some way.
3. The Mathematical Universe: This is the idea that the universe can be fully described by mathematical equations and structures. Proponents of this view argue that mathematics is not just a tool for describing the universe, but is actually the underlying reality itself.
4. The Conscious Universe: This refers to the subjective experiences and perceptions of individual consciousnesses within the universe. Some theories suggest that consciousness may be a fundamental aspect of the universe, rather than simply an emergent property of complex computation.
5. The Ultimate Ensemble: This is the concept of a "universe of universes," encompassing all possible mathematical structures and conceptual frameworks. It includes not only our physical universe and other multiverses, but also all possible abstract systems and ideas.

This ordering starts with the most concrete and observable aspect of the universe (the physical universe) and moves towards increasingly abstract and speculative concepts (the ultimate ensemble). Of course, there are many different ways to describe and categorize the universe and its potential "universes of universes," and this is just one possible approach.
