 Result: I am not sure I understand what you are asking for. The term "quasi-quote" comes from Lisp programming language and is used to include unevaluated expressions in a quoted list. It's not clear how this concept can be applied to describe the universe or a universe of universes, as it pertains to programming rather than to physical reality.

However, I will attempt to provide an answer based on my interpretation of your question. If we were to use a series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes in the context of set theory (which is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which are collections of objects), we could do it as follows:

* Type 1: The Universe - This would be the set of all physical objects, properties, and relations in our observable universe. It might include things like galaxies, stars, planets, atoms, subatomic particles, fields, forces, and events. We might denote this type as U.
* Type 2: A Multiverse - This would be a collection or "universe of universes" that includes our Universe (Type 1) as well as other possible universes, each with its own set of physical objects, properties, and relations. We might denote this type as M, where M = {U1, U2, U3, ...}.
* Type 3: A Multiverse of Multiverses - This would be a collection or "universe of multiverses" that includes multiple multiverses (Type 2), each with its own set of universes. We might denote this type as N, where N = {M1, M2, M3, ...}.
* Type 4: A Hyperverse - This would be a collection or "universe of hyperverses" that includes multiple levels of multiverses (Type 3), each with its own set of universes and multiverses. We might denote this type as H, where H = {N1, N2, N3, ...}.

This is just one possible way to describe the universe and a universe of universes using types, and there may be other ways to do it depending on the context and assumptions.
