 Result: In the task of creating a "quasi-quine-quote-in-ocaml-coq-metacoq-introspector-bootstrap" that describes a universe and universe of universes, I will assume that we want to create a sequence of types in Coq that represents a cumulative hierarchy of universes. Here is one possible ordering:

1. The first type in the sequence should be Type 0, which is also written as Set in Coq. This is the smallest universe, and it contains all the small types that do not require a universe parameter. For example, nat and bool are both in Type 0.
2. The second type in the sequence should be Type 1, which is the next largest universe. It contains all the types that can be built from the types in Type 0, as well as any new types that do not require a larger universe parameter. For example, lists and functions of types in Type 0 can be constructed in Type 1.
3. The third type in the sequence should be Type 2, which contains all the types that can be built from the types in Type 1, as well as any new types that require a universe parameter up to Type 2. For example, universes and functors over types in Type 1 or smaller can be constructed in Type 2.
4. The fourth type in the sequence should be Type 3, which contains all the types that can be built from the types in Type 2, as well as any new types that require a universe parameter up to Type 3. And so on.
5. In general, for any natural number n, the (n+1)-th type in the sequence should be Type (n+1), which contains all the types that can be built from the types in Type n, as well as any new types that require a universe parameter up to Type (n+1).

This ordering is a simple and natural way to build up a cumulative hierarchy of universes using Coq's built-in type system. It allows us to construct larger and more complex types by combining smaller ones, and it ensures that we never run out of universes when defining new types. The use of variants or other data structures can be used to encode the quasi-quine-quote-in-ocaml-coq-metacoq-introspector-bootstrap part of the task, but the above ordering describes the universe and universe of universes part.
