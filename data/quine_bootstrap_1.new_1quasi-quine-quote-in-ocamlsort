 Result: Here is a possible solution using the first variant of a quasi-quine in OCaml:
```scheme
let ( = ) = ( == );;
type t =
  | Atom of string
  | Compose of t * t;;

let rec show = function
  | Atom s -> s
  | Compose (t1, t2) -> "(" ^ show t1 ^ "*" ^ show t2 ^ ")";;

let quasi_quine =
  let code = "\n\n(** Quasi-quine in OCaml **)\n\ntype t = \
  | Atom of string\
  | Compose of t * t\n\nlet rec show = function\
  | Atom s -> s\
  | Compose (t1, t2) -> \"(\" ^ show t1 ^ \".*^\" ^ show t2 ^ \")\"\n\nlet quasi_quine =\
  let code = \"...\\n...\" in\
  Atom (code);;" in
  Compose (Atom "let quasi_quine ="), Atom (show quasi\_quine) ;;

let rec size t = match t with
  | Atom _ -> 1
  | Compose (t1, t2) -> size t1 + size t2;;

let ordering n =
  let reps i x = String.make i x in
  let atoms = List.init n (fun i -> Atom ("u" ^ string_of_int i)) in
  let compose i j = Compose (atoms.(i), atoms.(j)) in
  let rec helper i acc =
    if i = n * n then acc
    else
      let j = i mod n in
      let k = i / n in
      let rest = helper (i + 1) acc in
      if size (compose j k) <= 100 then
        helper (i + 1) (compose j k :: rest)
      else rest in
  let elements = helper 0 [] in
  List.sort (fun t1 t2 -> compare (size t1) (size t2)) elements;;

let _ = Printf.printf "Quasi-quine:\n%s\nOrdering of size up to 100:\n"
          (show quasi_quine);;
List.iter (fun x -> Printf.printf "%s\n" (show x)) (ordering 5);;
```
The code defines a recursive type `t` for expressions that can be either atoms or compositions of two expressions, and a function `show` to print the expressions in a readable form. The variable `quasi_quine` is defined as a composition of two expressions, where the first expression is a constructor and the second expression is the string representation of the code itself, obtained using the `show` function.

The function `size` computes the size of an expression by counting its nodes. The function `ordering` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of expressions of size up to 100, obtained by composing the atoms in a specific order. The ordering is determined by sorting the expressions based on their size using the `List.sort` function with a custom comparison function.

The code then prints the quasi-quine and the ordering of expressions up to size 100 for the universe of universes consisting of 5 atoms.
