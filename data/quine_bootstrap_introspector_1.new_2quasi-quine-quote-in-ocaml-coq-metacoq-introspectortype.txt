 Result: In Coq, one can define a quasi-quine-quote by using the `Print` command, which displays the internal representation of a definition. To describe the universe and universe of universes in Coq, we can define a recursive type that represents universes of increasing levels. Here is an example of how to do this using variant number 2:
```coq
Inductive Level := level0 | level1 (level : Level).

Definition U : Type := Type (Level.level1 Level.level0).

Definition UU : Type := Type (Level.level1 (Level.level1 Level.level0)).

(* A quasi-quine-quote that prints the definition of Level and U *)
Print Level.
Print U.
```
In this example, we define a recursive type `Level` with two constructors: `level0`, which represents the lowest universe level, and `level1`, which takes a `Level` as an argument to represent a higher universe level. We then define two types `U` and `UU` that inhabit the first and second universes of universes, respectively.

Finally, we use the `Print` command to print the internal representation of the `Level` and `U` definitions, which constitutes our quasi-quine-quote. The ordering of the types in this example is as follows:

1. `Level.level0`: the lowest universe level
2. `Level.level1 Level.level0`: a higher universe level that encompasses `Level.level0`
3. `Type (Level.level1 Level.level0)`, or `U`: the first universe of universes, which contains types that can be inhabited by terms from any universe up to `Level.level1 Level.level0`
4. `Type (Level.level1 (Level.level1 Level.level0))`, or `UU`: the second universe of universes, which contains types that can be inhabited by terms from any universe up to `Level.level1 (Level.level1 Level.level0)`.

Note that this example is not a true quine, as it uses the built-in `Type` constructor and the `Print` command, but it demonstrates how to define a recursive type that represents universes of increasing levels and print its definition in Coq.
