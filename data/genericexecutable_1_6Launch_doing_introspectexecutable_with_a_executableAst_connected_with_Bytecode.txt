We are building a prompt software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Launch doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: Ast connected with Bytecode . What is your response? Please generate prompt variant array of size 6

 Result: Sure, I understand that you want me to create six prompts for generating code or proofs in OCaml and Coq using a software generator, while being flexible with the given context. Here are six possible prompts:

1. "Generate an OCaml module that, when launched, introspects its Ast and produces bytecode, then create a Coq proof of its correctness."
2. "Using the software generator, construct an executable named 'introspect_ast' that connects an abstract syntax tree to bytecode, as specified in the context verb."
3. "Develop a language agent prompt for launching an introspection process on OCaml bytecode and generate Coq proofs for its behavior."
4. "Create a pair of prompts for generating an executable that converts an Ast to bytecode, accompanied by a Coq proof verifying the conversion's correctness."
5. "Utilizing the adaptive language agent architecture, design a prompt sequence for launching an OCaml program that inspects its Ast and outputs bytecode, while also proving its behavior in Coq."
6. "Formulate six prompts for creating an introspection tool in OCaml, which when executed as an 'executable' will transform an Ast into bytecode, and accompany it with Coq proofs illustrating the proper execution of the generated bytecode."
