 Result: In variant number 1, the consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and universe of universes can be ordered as follows:

1. The smallest set, which contains only the concept of "existence" or "being." This set can be considered the most fundamental aspect of reality, encompassing all that exists in any possible universe.
2. The next set contains the basic building blocks of our physical universe, such as particles and forces. These elements are the foundation for the structures and phenomena observed in our universe.
3. The third set includes all the various structures and phenomena that exist within our universe, such as galaxies, stars, planets, and life. This set encompasses the full range of complexity and diversity found in our cosmos.
4. The fourth set contains all possible universes, each with its own unique set of particles, forces, structures, and phenomena. This set represents the "multiverse" or "universe of universes," encompassing all that exists across all possible realities.
5. Finally, the largest set contains all conceivable concepts and possibilities, including those beyond our current understanding or imagination. This set is the ultimate expression of the concept of "everything" or "the totality of all that exists."

In summary, the ordering for variant number 1 would be:

1. The concept of existence/being
2. Basic building blocks of our physical universe (particles and forces)
3. Structures and phenomena within our universe
4. Possible universes (multiverse or universe of universes)
5. All conceivable concepts and possibilities.
