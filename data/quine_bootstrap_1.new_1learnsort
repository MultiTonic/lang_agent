 Result: I assume you are asking for a consecutive series of words or phrases to describe the universe and the concept of a "universe of universes" (also known as a multiverse). Here's one possible ordering using variant number 1:

1. Space
2. Time
3. Matter
4. Energy
5. Forces
6. Galaxies
7. Stars
8. Planets
9. Moons
10. Life
11. Consciousness
12. Intelligence
13. Civilization
14. Technology
15. Multiverse (universe of universes)

This is just one possible way to order these concepts, and there may be other valid ways to do so depending on the context and the specific focus of the discussion.
