 Result: I'm assuming you are asking for a consecutive series of words or phrases that can be used to describe the universe and the concept of a "universe of universes" (also known as a multiverse), using variant number 1. Here's one possible encoding:

1. Cosmos
2. Space
3. Galaxies
4. Stars
5. Planets
6. Life
7. Consciousness
8. Mind
9. Reality
10. Multiverse

This ordering starts with the largest and most encompassing concept (the cosmos) and moves towards smaller and more specific concepts, ending with the idea of a multiverse, which includes many universes. The ordering can be seen as a way to move from the outer bounds of the universe to its inner workings and ultimate nature, including the possibility of multiple overlapping or parallel realities.
