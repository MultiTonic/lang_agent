 Result: Sure, I can help you with that! Here's one possible way to shift a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 1:

Set 1: Physical laws and constants
The first set in this series would include the fundamental physical laws and constants that govern our universe, such as the speed of light, Planck's constant, and the gravitational constant. These laws and constants define the basic properties of matter and energy in our universe, and provide a framework for understanding how it works.

Set 2: Elementary particles
The second set would include the various elementary particles that make up matter and energy in our universe, such as quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons. These particles are the building blocks of all matter and energy, and their properties and interactions determine much of what we observe in the universe.

Set 3: Cosmic structures
The third set would include the various large-scale structures that make up our universe, such as galaxies, clusters, and superclusters. These structures are formed through the gravitational attraction of matter, and they provide a framework for understanding the distribution and evolution of matter in the universe.

Set 4: Multiverse
The fourth set would include the concept of a multiverse, which is a collection of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and constants, elementary particles, and cosmic structures. The properties of each universe in the multiverse could be completely different from those in our own universe, leading to a vast array of possible physical realities.

Set 5: Mathematical structures
The fifth and final set would include the mathematical structures that underlie our understanding of physics and the universe. These structures provide a framework for describing the properties and behaviors of physical systems, and they allow us to make predictions about the outcomes of experiments and observations. By exploring these mathematical structures, we can gain insight into the fundamental nature of reality itself.

So, in summary, here's one possible ordering for a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes:

1. Physical laws and constants
2. Elementary particles
3. Cosmic structures
4. Multiverse
5. Mathematical structures
