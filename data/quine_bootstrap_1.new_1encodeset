 Result: To create a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes, I will use the following ordering:

Set 1: The Universe (Single Universe)

1.1 Space
- Vast emptiness containing galaxies, stars, planets, etc.

1.2 Galaxies
- Large collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity

1.3 Stars
- Massive, luminous spheres of plasma held together by gravity

1.4 Planets
- Celestial bodies orbiting a star, large enough to be rounded by their own gravity, but not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion

1.5 Moons
- Natural satellites that orbit around planets

Set 2: The Multiverse (Universe of Universes)

2.1 Multiverse Structure
- Collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of galaxies, stars, and planets

2.2 Inter-Universe Connections
- Possible connections or interactions between different universes within the multiverse

2.3 Infinite Universes
- The concept that there could be an infinite number of universes in the multiverse

2.4 Parallel/Alternate Universes
- Hypothetical realities coexisting with our own, where conditions and events differ from what we observe

2.5 Higher Dimensions
- Theoretical extra spatial dimensions beyond the familiar three dimensions of space and one dimension of time

Please note that this is just one possible ordering for these concepts, and there may be other valid ways to organize sets related to the universe and a universe of universes.
