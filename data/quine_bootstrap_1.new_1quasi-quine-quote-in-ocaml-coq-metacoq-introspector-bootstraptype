 Result: The task asks for a "quasi-quine-quote" in OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq that describes the universe and universe of universes. I will provide an ordering for this task using variant number 1, which is to provide a quasi-quine in OCaml that describes the OCaml universe.

The ordering of the tasks would be as follows:

1. Quasi-quine in OCaml: This task involves writing a program in OCaml that outputs its own source code when executed, but with a twist - it should also include comments that describe the OCaml universe, including information about basic types (such as int, bool, char), functions, data structures (such as lists and tuples), modules, objects, and other language features. This will provide an overview of the OCaml universe.
2. Quasi-quine in Coq: Building on the information provided in the OCaml quasi-quine, this task involves writing a program in Coq that outputs its own source code when executed, but with comments that describe the Coq universe, including information about basic types (such as nat, bool), functions, inductive types, records, and other language features. This will provide an overview of the Coq universe.
3. Quasi-quine in MetaCoq: Finally, this task involves writing a program in MetaCoq that outputs its own source code when executed, but with comments that describe the MetaCoq universe, including information about the syntax and semantics of both OCaml and Coq, as well as the meta-theory used to reason about them. This will provide an overview of the MetaCoq universe.
4. Introspection: Once all three quasi-quines have been created, this task involves using each one to introspect on its own language and reflect on the relationships between OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq. This will allow for a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences between these languages and their universes.
5. Bootstrapping: The final step is to use the information gathered from the previous tasks to design and implement a bootstrapping process that can be used to create new versions of OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq, each building on the previous one. This will demonstrate the power and flexibility of these languages and their universes, as well as the potential for further exploration and development.

Overall, this series of tasks is designed to provide a deep and comprehensive understanding of the OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq universes, as well as the relationships between them. By using quasi-quines and introspection, we can gain insights into the strengths and limitations of each language, and develop new techniques for building powerful and flexible software systems.
