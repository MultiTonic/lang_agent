 Result: Sure, I can help with that. Here's a possible consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse), using Variant Number 1:

1. Type-0: The Multiverse - This is the highest level type, which contains all possible universes, including our own universe. It is also known as the "cosmic landscape" or the "landscape of string theory."
2. Type-1: The Universe - This is a subset of the multiverse, which contains all matter, energy, space and time that exist within its boundaries. Our own universe is an example of a Type-1 object.
3. Type-2: Galaxy - A galaxy is a large collection of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. The Milky Way, the galaxy in which our solar system resides, is an example of a Type-2 object.
4. Type-3: Star - A star is a massive, luminous sphere of plasma held together by gravity. Our sun is an example of a Type-3 object.
5. Type-4: Planet - A planet is a celestial body that orbits a star and is neither a star nor its satellite. Earth is an example of a Type-4 object.
6. Type-5: Moon - A moon is a natural satellite that orbits a planet. The Moon, which orbits the Earth, is an example of a Type-5 object.
7. Type-6: Continent - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. There are seven continents: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and South America.
8. Type-7: Country - A country is a political entity that is sovereign over a geographic area. The United States, for example, is a Type-7 object.
9. Type-8: City - A city is a large human settlement. New York City, for example, is a Type-8 object.
10. Type-9: Building - A building is a structure with a roof and walls, such as a house or office building. The Empire State Building in New York City is an example of a Type-9 object.
11. Type-10: Room - A room is a space within a building that is enclosed by walls, floor, and ceiling. A bedroom, for example, is a Type-10 object.

This ordering starts with the largest possible collection of universes (the multiverse) and ends with the smallest possible subdivision of space within a building (a room). It provides a coherent framework for thinking about the hierarchy of objects in the universe and beyond.
