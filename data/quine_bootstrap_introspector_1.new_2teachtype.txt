 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here is one possible way to describe the universe and a "universe of universes" using a consecutive series of types, along with an explanation for each type:

1. Fundamental Particles: These are the basic building blocks of matter, such as quarks, leptons, and bosons. They interact with each other through four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force.
2. Atoms: Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. They combine to form molecules, which in turn make up the matter that we see around us.
3. Stars and Galaxies: Stars are massive balls of hot, glowing gas that generate energy through nuclear fusion. Galaxies are vast collections of stars, along with gas, dust, and dark matter. Our own galaxy is called the Milky Way.
4. The Universe: The universe is the totality of all matter, energy, space, and time. It is thought to have begun around 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang, an explosion of immense energy that created all of the matter and radiation in the universe.
5. Multiverse: A multiverse is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of fundamental particles, atoms, stars, galaxies, and laws of physics. It's important to note that there is currently no empirical evidence for the existence of a multiverse, but it is a topic of active research in theoretical physics.
6. Universe of Universes: This is a concept that goes beyond the multiverse. It refers to a hypothetical collection of multiple multiverses, each with its own set of universes, fundamental particles, atoms, stars, galaxies, and laws of physics. Like the multiverse, there is currently no empirical evidence for the existence of a universe of universes, but it is a topic of speculation in some areas of science fiction and philosophy.

So, using variant number 2, here's how we could describe the universe and universe of universes in a consecutive series of types:

Type 1: Fundamental particles
Type 2: Atoms
Type 3: Stars and galaxies
Type 4: The universe (including all matter, energy, space, and time)
Type 5: Multiverse (a collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of fundamental particles, atoms, stars, galaxies, and laws of physics)
Type 6: Universe of universes (a hypothetical collection of multiple multiverses, each with its own set of universes, fundamental particles, atoms, stars, galaxies, and laws of physics)
