 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here is a possible consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse), using Variant 1:

1. The set of all physical particles in the universe. This set includes all elementary particles such as quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons, as well as composite particles such as protons, neutrons, and atoms.
2. The set of all fields in the universe. This set includes all fundamental forces in nature, such as gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force. It also includes the Higgs field, which is responsible for giving other particles mass.
3. The set of all galaxies in the universe. This set includes all the large structures made up of stars, gas, and dust, including spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, irregular galaxies, and dwarf galaxies.
4. The set of all clusters and superclusters of galaxies in the universe. This set includes the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe, which contain thousands to millions of galaxies each.
5. The set of all possible universes that could exist in a multiverse. This set includes all possible configurations of matter, energy, and fields that could give rise to a self-contained realm of existence, with its own laws of physics and initial conditions.
6. The set of all mathematical structures that can be described by set theory. This set includes all the abstract entities that can be defined using sets, such as numbers, functions, shapes, and spaces.
7. The set of all possible worlds in a modal logic framework. This set includes all the possible states of affairs that could obtain or not obtain, depending on how things might have been different.
8. The set of all conceptual schemes or frameworks for understanding the world. This set includes all the ways in which humans and other intelligent beings can make sense of their experiences and categorize them into meaningful patterns.
9. The set of all values or normative principles that guide human behavior. This set includes all the ethical, aesthetic, and practical considerations that people use to evaluate actions, states of affairs, or character traits.
10. The set of all possible meanings or interpretations of a text or discourse. This set includes all the different ways in which language can be used to convey meaning, express attitudes, or evoke responses.
