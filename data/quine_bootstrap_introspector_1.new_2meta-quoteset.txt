 Result: I'm assuming that by "set" you mean "statement" or "description." Here is a possible consecutive series of statements to describe the universe and the universe of universes (also known as the multiverse or the metaverse), using variant number 2:

1. The universe is the totality of all matter, energy, space, and time, according to physical cosmology. It contains all galaxies, stars, planets, and other forms of matter and energy, as well as all the physical laws and constants that govern their behavior.
2. The universe has a finite age, estimated to be around 13.8 billion years, based on observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and other evidence. It also has a finite size, estimated to be around 93 billion light-years in diameter, based on measurements of the rate of expansion of the universe.
3. The universe may have begun as a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature, according to the Big Bang theory. The singularity expanded and cooled, forming particles, atoms, molecules, stars, galaxies, and other structures over billions of years.
4. The universe may contain multiple regions or bubbles, each with its own set of matter, energy, space, and time. These regions are causally disconnected, meaning that they cannot communicate with each other through any known means of signal transmission. They are also expanding at different rates, according to the theory of inflation.
5. The universe of universes is a hypothetical concept that describes a collection or hierarchy of universes, each with its own set of matter, energy, space, and time. This idea is inspired by various theories and models in theoretical physics, such as string theory, brane theory, and cyclic models of the multiverse.
6. The universe of universes may have different properties and behaviors than our universe, such as different dimensions, topologies, symmetries, interactions, or histories. It may also contain different types of objects and phenomena, such as higher-dimensional membranes, wormholes, black holes, or parallel worlds.
7. The universe of universes may be infinite, eternal, unique, or cyclic, depending on the specific theory or model that describes it. It may also be subject to different laws and principles than our universe, such as quantum mechanics, general relativity, or other fundamental theories.
8. The universe of universes may have implications for the nature of reality, consciousness, information, causality, probability, and infinity. It may also have implications for the meaning, purpose, origin, destiny, or fate of our universe and ourselves.
