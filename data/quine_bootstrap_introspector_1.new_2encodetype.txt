 Result: Sure, I can do that! For this task, I will use a hierarchical structure to describe the universe and the "universe of universes" (also known as the multiverse). I will use variant 2, which consists of encoding a series of types with numbers. Here is one possible way to encode the universe and the multiverse using this method:

1. Type 1: Fundamental particles - These are the basic building blocks of matter, such as electrons, quarks, and photons.
2. Type 2: Atoms - Atoms are made up of fundamental particles and are the smallest units of matter that retain the properties of an element.
3. Type 3: Molecules - Molecules are groups of atoms that are chemically bonded together. They can be simple, such as water (H2O), or complex, such as proteins.
4. Type 4: Cells - Cells are the basic units of life and are composed of molecules. They can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic.
5. Type 5: Organisms - Organisms are made up of one or more cells and can be unicellular or multicellular.
6. Type 6: Ecosystems - Ecosystems are communities of organisms that interact with each other and their physical environment.
7. Type 7: Planets - Planets are large celestial bodies that orbit a star. They are made up of rocks, metals, and gases.
8. Type 8: Stars - Stars are massive, luminous balls of plasma that generate energy through nuclear fusion.
9. Type 9: Galaxies - Galaxies are vast systems of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter that are bound together by gravity.
10. Type 10: The multiverse - The multiverse is the collection of all possible universes, including our own universe.

Note that this is just one way to encode the universe and the multiverse using a hierarchical structure, and there may be other valid ways to do so.
