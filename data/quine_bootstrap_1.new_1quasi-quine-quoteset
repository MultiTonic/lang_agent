 Result: I'm not entirely sure I understand your request, but it seems like you are asking for a "quasi-quine-quote" that describes the universe and the concept of a "universe of universes" (also known as a multiverse). A quasi-quine is a sequence of text that describes itself in some way. Here is one possible answer, using variant number 1:
```
"This is a consecutive series of sets used to describe the universe and the concept of a multiverse. Set 1: The universe is described as everything that exists, including all matter, energy, space, and time. Set 2: A multiverse is a hypothetical grouping of multiple universes, including our own. This description is self-referential, as it uses the term 'set' to describe the organization of these ideas."
```
Note that this is just one possible interpretation of your request, and there may be other valid ways to approach this problem.
