 Result: 

There are various ways to order the types of descriptions for the universe and the universe of universes, depending on one's philosophical or scientific perspective. Here are a few possibilities:

1. Empiricist approach: Start with observable phenomena at the most fundamental level (physics) and gradually add more abstract layers (chemistry, biology, psychology, sociology, etc.) to describe the universe. For the universe of universes, one could consider various models of multiverse theories or parallel universes based on physical laws and observations.
2. Rationalist approach: Start with abstract concepts
