 Result: Sure, I can provide a series of concepts to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse) in a logical order. Here is one possible way to do it:

1. The Physical Universe: This is the observable universe that we are all familiar with. It consists of galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy that we can detect using our scientific instruments.
2. The Multiverse: This concept goes beyond the physical universe to include all possible universes that could exist, including those that are completely different from our own. Some theories suggest that there may be an infinite number of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties.
3. Consciousness or Mind: This is the subjective experience of being alive and aware of one's surroundings. While consciousness is often studied in the context of individual organisms, it is also possible to consider consciousness as a fundamental aspect of the universe itself. Some theories suggest that consciousness may be a basic property of the universe, much like space and time.
4. Information or Data: This concept refers to the fundamental building blocks of reality, which can be thought of as patterns of information or data. According to some theories, the universe itself is made up of information, and everything that exists can be described in terms of its underlying data structure.
5. Mathematical Structures: At the most abstract level, the universe can be described using mathematical structures such as sets, groups, and categories. These structures provide a way to describe the fundamental laws of physics and the relationships between different aspects of the universe.
6. The Ultimate Reality or Absolute: This is the most mysterious and difficult-to-define concept in the series, as it goes beyond even the multiverse to include all possible realities, both physical and non-physical. Some theories suggest that the ultimate reality may be a kind of formless, timeless void, while others propose more complex models involving multiple levels of reality or consciousness.

This is just one possible way to order these concepts, and there are many other ways to approach the topic depending on one's philosophical or scientific perspective.
