 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's one possible way to design a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using Variant Number 1:

1. Type 0: The Physical Universe - This type refers to the physical universe that we are all familiar with, consisting of galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy.
2. Type 1: The Multiverse - This type refers to a collection of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. The multiverse may contain an infinite number of universes, each potentially very different from the others.
3. Type 2: The Mathematical Universe - This type refers to the concept of a universe that is entirely mathematical in nature. In this universe, all objects and phenomena can be described using mathematical equations and concepts.
4. Type 3: The Conscious Universe - This type refers to the idea that consciousness itself may be a fundamental aspect of the universe, rather than simply an emergent property of certain physical systems. In this view, the universe itself may be conscious, or at least contain conscious entities.
5. Type 4: The Simulation Universe - This type refers to the possibility that our entire universe is actually a computer simulation created by some advanced civilization. In this scenario, our universe would be just one of many simulations running on a vast cosmic computer.
6. Type 5: The Ultimate Universe - This type refers to the idea of a single, all-encompassing universe that contains everything, including all other universes and dimensions. This ultimate universe may be infinite in size, eternal in duration, and beyond our ability to fully comprehend.

Of course, there are many other ways to categorize and describe the universe and its potential variations, but this is one possible framework for thinking about these concepts.
