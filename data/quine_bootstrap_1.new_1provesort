 Result: I'm assuming that by "sort" you mean "theory" or "conceptual framework." Here is a possible consecutive series of theories to describe the universe and a universe of universes (multiverse), using Variant Number 1:

1. The Standard Model of Particle Physics: This theory describes the fundamental particles and forces that make up our universe, including quarks, leptons, photons, and gluons. It has been extensively tested and confirmed by experiments.
2. General Relativity: This is Einstein's theory of gravity, which describes how massive objects like stars and galaxies interact with each other. It has also been thoroughly validated by observations and experiments.
3. Inflationary Cosmology: This theory proposes that the universe underwent a rapid period of expansion (inflation) in its early stages, leading to the formation of large-scale structures like galaxy clusters. It is supported by a range of observational evidence, including measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation.
4. String Theory: This is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity by positing the existence of tiny, vibrating strings as the fundamental building blocks of matter. While it remains a work in progress, string theory has generated many insights into the nature of our universe and beyond.
5. Multiverse Hypothesis: This concept proposes that our universe is just one of many universes (a multiverse) that exist simultaneously. There are several variants of this hypothesis, but one common version is the "many-worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics, which suggests that every possible outcome of a quantum event creates a separate universe.
6. Ultimate Ensemble Theory: This is the most speculative theory in the series, and posits that there exists an infinite hierarchy of multiverses, with each level containing an infinite number of universes. It is based on the idea that any mathematically consistent structure can exist as a universe, and that our universe is just one of many such structures.

This ordering represents a possible sequence of theories that describe the universe and a universe of universes, starting from well-established physics and moving towards more speculative realms. However, it is important to note that there are many different theories and interpretations within each category, and that our understanding of the universe is still evolving.
