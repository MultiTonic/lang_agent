 Result: I am not able to understand the exact request you are making, as it seems to include multiple concepts and technologies that are not directly related. However, I can try to provide some information about each concept separately, which may help you understand how they could potentially be used in a series or hierarchy of sets describing the universe and universe of universes.

1. Quine-quote: A quine is a program that outputs its own source code as its output. A quasi-quine is a similar idea, but allows for a small amount of "fixed" code that doesn't need to be part of the output. A quote-like structure can be used to represent a program in a way that can be manipulated and analyzed by other programs.
2. OCaml: OCaml is a programming language that is known for its strong static typing, pattern matching, and functional programming features. It has been used in a variety of applications including compilers, web servers, and financial systems.
3. Coq: Coq is an interactive theorem prover that allows users to write formal proofs in a dependently typed language. Coq can be used to verify the correctness of programs and mathematical theories.
4. MetaCoq: MetaCoq is a project that aims to develop a framework for reasoning about Coq itself, by providing a meta-language that can be used to reason about Coq's type theory and implementation.
5. Introspection: In programming, introspection refers to the ability of a program to inspect its own structure and behavior at runtime. This can be useful for debugging, testing, and metaprogramming.
6. Bootstrapping: In computer science, bootstrapping refers to the process of building up a system from simpler components. For example, a compiler can be bootstrapped by writing a small program in assembly language that can compile the compiler itself into machine code.

In terms of ordering or hierarchy, one possible way to organize these concepts would be as follows:

1. The base set would consist of the universe of sets, which could be represented using a set theory like ZFC or a type theory like Coq's.
2. One level up, we could have a set of programs written in OCaml that manipulate and reason about the base set. This could include quasi-quines and other programmatic structures.
3. Another level up, we could have a set of proofs written in Coq that verify the correctness of the programs at the previous level. These proofs could use MetaCoq to introspect and reason about Coq's own type theory and implementation.
4. Finally, we could have a bootstrapping process that uses Coq to compile its own source code into machine code, creating a self-hosting system that can verify the correctness of its own implementation.

Note that this is just one possible way to organize these concepts, and there may be other ways to do so depending on the specific goals and requirements of a project.
