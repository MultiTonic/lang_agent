 Result: 

To answer this question, let me first clarify some terms. By "universe," I assume you mean the physical universe we inhabit, which includes all matter and energy that exists or can be observed. By "universe of universes" or "multiverse," I interpret as a collection of universes, possibly including our own.

As for the ordering of types to describe these realms, there are several approaches one could take depending on philosophical, scientific, or mathematical perspectives. Here are some possibilities:

1. Physics-centric approach: Start with basic physical descriptions such as point particles
