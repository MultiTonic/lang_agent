 Result: The task asks for a quasi-quine that describes a series of sets used to describe the universe and universe of universes. In OCaml, Coq, or Metacoq, we might define such sets as data types (i.e., algebraic datatypes in OCaml/Coq, sum types in Metacoq). However, creating a quasi-quine that constructs these sets is challenging and not very instructive.

Instead, I will describe an ordering of sets that can be used to model the universe and the universe of universes, using the paradigm of type theory.

In type theory, there are various levels of types, called universes. A universe is a set of types. Each universe is a member of another universe (called its "next" or "larger" universe), forming an infinite hierarchy of universes: U0 : U1 : U2 : ... The bottom-most universe U0 contains the smallest types, such as bool and int, while larger universes contain more complex types.

We can use this idea to order a series of sets that represent the universe and the universe of universes:

* Universe 0 (U0): Contains basic data types such as booleans, integers, characters, etc.
* Universe 1 (U1): Contains function types, product types, sum types, and other composite types built from U0 types.
* Universe 2 (U2): Contains the universe type constructors, allowing for the creation of new universes containing U0, U1, and any other previously defined universes.
* ...
* Universe n (Un): Contains the universe type constructor allowing for the creation of new universes up to Un-1.

This ordering creates a hierarchy of sets that can represent various levels of types in type theory. The "universe of universes" is represented by the set containing all previously defined universes, which grows as we add larger and larger universes to the series.
