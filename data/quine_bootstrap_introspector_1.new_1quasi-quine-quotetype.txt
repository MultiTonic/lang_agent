 Result: I'm afraid I don't understand your request. A quasi-quine is a program that outputs a nearly identical version of itself. It's not clear how this concept could be extended to "describe the universe and universe of universes" or what you mean by "variant number 1."

If you could provide more context or clarify your question, I would be happy to try to answer it. In the meantime, here is an example of a quasi-quine in Python:
```
s = 's = %r\nprint(s%%s)'
print(s%s)
```
This program prints the string `s = 's = %r\nprint(s%%s)'`, which is almost identical to the original source code. The only difference is that the `%r` format specifier has been replaced with `%s`. This allows the program to print a nearly identical version of itself, making it a quasi-quine.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
