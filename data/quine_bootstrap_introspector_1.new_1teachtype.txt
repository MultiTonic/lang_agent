 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a possible consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse), using Variant Number 1:

1. Physical Universe: This is the observable universe that we live in, consisting of galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy. It is governed by the laws of physics and has been expanding since the Big Bang approximately 13.8 billion years ago.
2. Mathematical Universe: This is a conceptual framework that describes the universe using mathematical structures and concepts. It posits that the physical universe is just one possible manifestation of an underlying mathematical reality, which can be described using equations and formulas.
3. Simulation Universe: This is the idea that our universe is not "real" in the traditional sense, but rather a simulation or virtual reality created by advanced beings or artificial intelligence. While this theory is still speculative, it raises interesting questions about the nature of reality and consciousness.
4. Multiverse: This is a collection or ensemble of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. The multiverse can be thought of as a "universe of universes," encompassing all possible configurations of matter and energy.
5. Metaverse: This is a hypothetical universe that exists beyond the multiverse, encompassing all possible realities and dimensions. It is often associated with concepts such as higher-dimensional spaces, string theory, and the nature of consciousness.
6. Ultimate Reality: This is the ultimate underlying reality or truth that underlies all other levels of reality. It may be unknowable or ineffable, beyond the grasp of human understanding or language. Some philosophical and spiritual traditions posit the existence of an ultimate reality as the source or ground of all being.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or clarifications.
