 Result: Sure, I can provide a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes using Variant Number 1. Here's my suggestion:

1. Type 0: Physical Universe - This type refers to the physical universe that we are all familiar with, consisting of galaxies, stars, planets, and other forms of matter and energy.
2. Type 1: Multiverse - This type refers to a collection of universes, each with its own set of galaxies, stars, planets, and other forms of matter and energy. The multiverse is the universe of universes.
3. Type 2: Mathematical Universe - This type refers to the set of all possible mathematical structures, which includes all the physical laws and theories that govern our universe and all other universes in the multiverse.
4. Type 3: Conceptual Universe - This type refers to the set of all concepts, ideas, and abstractions that exist beyond the realm of mathematics. It includes philosophical concepts like truth, beauty, and goodness, as well as artistic creations like paintings, music, and literature.
5. Type 4: Ultimate Universe - This type refers to the ultimate reality that underlies all other types of universes. It is the source of all being and existence, and it is beyond space, time, and causality.

This ordering starts with the most concrete and tangible universe (the physical universe) and moves towards increasingly abstract and intangible universes (the mathematical, conceptual, and ultimate universes). The multiverse is included as a separate type to emphasize its status as a collection of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and structures.
