 Result: The task you have given can be interpreted in several ways, but I will assume that you want a sequence of OCaml types that describe a universe and a universe of universes, using the tools mentioned. Here is one possible solution:

1. Variant type for quine-quote
```ocaml
type qq = QQ of qq
```
2. Universe type in Coq, using the `Type` universe
```coq
Inductive UU :=
| U : Type -> UU.
```
3. Universe of universes type in Coq, parameterized by a universe
```coq
Inductive UUs (us : UU) : Type :=
| Uu : forall u : UU, us = U u -> UUs u.
```
4. Introspection and bootstrapping functions in MetaCoq
```ocaml
type _ env = ...  (* meta-level environment type; omitted for brevity *)

val get_type_of_term : Term.t -> (env * Typ.t) option Ltac_plugin.t
val infer_type_of_term : Term.t -> env * Typ.t Ltac_plugin.t
val typecheck_term : env -> Term.t -> Typ.t -> unit Ltac_plugin.t

(* Get the MetaCoq environment from the current proof state, and use it to 
   introspect and manipulate the OCaml typing of terms *)
let get_meta_env () : env = ...

(* Define a term that represents the above typechecking function as an OCaml value *)
let meta_typechecker_term : Term.t = ...

(* Use the MetaCoq introspection functions to get the type of the 
   meta-level typechecking function *)
let meta_typechecker_type : Typ.t =
  let open Coqlib in
  match get_type_of_term meta_typechecker_term with
  | Some (env, t) ->
    typecheck_term env meta_typechecker_term t;
    t
  | None -> assert false
```
5. Decision function for whether a term has the universe of universes type in Coq
```coq
Definition isUUs (uus : UUs) (t : Term.t) :=
  match uus with
  | Uu _ h => eq_refl h = Term.eq_refl t
  end.

Theorem is_UUs_true (uus : UUs) (t : Term.t) : isUUs uus t = true -> Type.level uus > Level.max_pos.
Proof. simpl; intuition. Qed.
```
Note that the order of the types in this solution is not arbitrary, but rather reflects a dependency relationship between the concepts being represented:

- The quine-quote type (1) is used to define self-referential terms and types, but it plays no direct role in describing universes or universe hierarchies.
- The Coq `UU` type (2) represents a single universe of types, which can be seen as a subset of the OCaml type system.
- The Coq `UUs` type (3) parameterized by a universe represents a hierarchy of universes, which can be used to model different levels of impredicativity and size constraints.
- The MetaCoq functions (4) allow us to introspect and manipulate the OCaml typing of terms within Coq, using the same type system that underlies both languages. This is necessary for defining a term that represents the meta-level typechecking function as an OCaml value.
- The Coq `isUUs` definition (5) allows us to determine whether a given term has the universe of universes type, which is an important property in certain metatheoretic proofs and constructions.
