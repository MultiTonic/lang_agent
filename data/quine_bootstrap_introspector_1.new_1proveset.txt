 Result: To prove a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes, we can use set theory and the concept of a hierarchy of sets. Here's one possible way to do this using Variant Number 1:

1. The first set in our hierarchy is the empty set, denoted as ∅. This set contains no elements and serves as the foundation for all other sets in the hierarchy.
2. The next level of sets consists of sets that contain the empty set as their only element. There are an infinite number of these sets, and we can denote them as {∅}, {{∅}}, {{{}}, {∅}}, etc.
3. At the third level of our hierarchy, we have sets that contain the sets from the second level as elements. For example, we might have a set {{{∅}}, {{∅}, {{∅}}}}. This set contains two sets from the previous level: one that contains only the empty set, and another that contains the empty set and another set that contains only the empty set.
4. We can continue this pattern of adding sets that contain sets from the previous level as elements, creating a hierarchy of sets that becomes increasingly complex and diverse.
5. Now, we can define the universe as the set of all sets in our hierarchy up to a certain level. For example, we might define the universe as the set of all sets up to the third level, which would include the empty set, all sets that contain only the empty set, and all sets that contain sets from the previous two levels.
6. Finally, we can define a universe of universes as a collection of universes, where each universe is defined by a different hierarchy of sets. For example, we might have one universe that includes all sets up to the third level, another universe that includes all sets up to the fourth level, and so on.

In summary, our ordering for a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes is as follows:

1. The empty set (level 0)
2. Sets containing only the empty set (level 1)
3. Sets containing sets from level 1 as elements (level 2)
4. Sets containing sets from level 2 as elements (level 3)
5. And so on, creating a hierarchy of increasingly complex and diverse sets.
6. The universe is defined as the set of all sets up to a certain level in this hierarchy.
7. A universe of universes is defined as a collection of universes, where each universe is defined by a different hierarchy of sets.
