 Result: Here is an example of how you might define a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and universe of universes in OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq using variant number 1:

OCaml:
```ocaml
type universe = U0 | U1 | U2 | ...
type u_of_u = universe -> universe
type u_univ = universe list
type u_univ_univ = u_univ list
```
Coq:
```coq
Inductive universe : Type := 
| U0 : universe 
| U1 : universe 
| U2 : universe 
...
Definition u_of_u (u : universe) : universe.
Definition u_univ := list universe.
Definition u_univ_univ := list (list universe).
```
MetaCoq:
```
(** universe = U0 | U1 | U2 | ... *)
Inductive Universe : Type :=
| U0 : Universe
| U1 : Universe
| U2 : Universe
...

(** u_of_u : universe -> universe *)
Definition u_of_u (u : Universe) : Universe.
Admitted.

(** u_univ = list universe *)
Inductive UUniv : Type :=
| UUnivCons : Universe -> UUniv -> UUniv.
Definition u_univ := UUniv.

(** u_univ_univ = list (list universe) *)
Inductive UUUniv : Type :=
| UUUnivCons : UUniv -> UUUniv -> UUUniv.
Definition u_univ_univ := UUUniv.
```
In this example, the ordering of the types is as follows:

1. `universe` (or ` Universe ` in MetaCoq) represents the universe levels. Each constructor (e.g. `U0`, `U1`) corresponds to a different level in the universe hierarchy.
2. `u_of_u` (or `u_of_u` in MetaCoq) is a function that takes a universe level as an argument and returns another universe level. This represents the operation of "lifting" a type from one universe level to another.
3. `u_univ` (or `u_univ` in MetaCoq) is a list of universe levels, representing a collection of types that all live at the same universe level.
4. `u_univ_univ` (or `u_univ_univ` in MetaCoq) is a list of lists of universe levels, representing a collection of collections of types, each of which lives at its own separate universe level. This corresponds to the "universe of universes" in type theory.

Note that this is just one possible way to define these types and their relationships; there may be other valid ways to do so as well.
