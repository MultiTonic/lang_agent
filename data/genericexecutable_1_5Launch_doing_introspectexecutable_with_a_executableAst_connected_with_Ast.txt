We are building a prompt software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Launch doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: Ast connected with Ast . What is your response? Please generate prompt variant array of size 5

 Result: Sure, I understand that you want me to create 5 prompts for generating code or proofs in OCaml and Coq using a language model and proof engine within an adaptive language agent architecture. The prompts will be based on the context provided, where the verb is "Launch", the type name is "executable with an executable", and the place is "Ast connected with Ast". Here are 5 possible prompts:

1. "Generate a prompt to launch the construction of an executable in OCaml that interacts with an Ast, using a large language model and proof engine."
2. "Create a prompt for launching an introspection process on an executable in Coq, given an Ast connected to another Ast, within the context of an adaptive language agent architecture."
3. "Design a prompt that launches the generation of an executable with an executable in OCaml, where the execution is based on an Ast connected to an Ast, and facilitated by a large language model and proof engine."
4. "Formulate a prompt for launching the verification of an Ast connection within an executable written in Coq, using a proof engine and a large language model as part of an adaptive language agent architecture."
5. "In the context of building a software generator with OCaml and Coq proofs, create a prompt that launches the creation of an executable with an executable, where the process involves introspection on an Ast connected to another Ast, facilitated by a large language model and proof engine within an adaptive language agent architecture."
