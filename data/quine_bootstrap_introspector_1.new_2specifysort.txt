 Result: In Variant #2, I will provide a consecutive series of sorts to describe the universe and the universe of universes (multiverse) using a hierarchical structure.

1. Fundamental particles: The smallest building blocks of matter, such as quarks, leptons, and bosons.
2. Elementary particles: Combinations of fundamental particles that form particles with unique properties, like electrons, neutrinos, and photons.
3. Atoms: The basic units of matter, composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons.
4. Molecules: Combinations of atoms that form chemical compounds through covalent or ionic bonding.
5. Macroscopic objects: Objects visible to the naked eye, made up of molecules and/or atoms, such as rocks, water, and living organisms.
6. Planets: Celestial bodies orbiting a star, composed primarily of rock, metal, or gas.
7. Stars: Luminous spheres of plasma held together by gravity, producing energy through nuclear fusion.
8. Star clusters: Gravitationally bound groups of stars, including open clusters and globular clusters.
9. Galaxies: Large collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, bound together by gravitational forces, such as spiral, elliptical, and irregular galaxies.
10. Galaxy clusters: Gravitationally bound groups of galaxies, often containing thousands of individual galaxies.
11. Cosmic structures: Large-scale structures formed by the distribution of matter in the universe, including voids, filaments, and superclusters.
12. Multiverse: A hypothetical collection of multiple universes, each potentially having its own set of fundamental particles, forces, and dimensions.

This hierarchical series starts from the smallest known components of the universe (fundamental particles) and moves up through increasingly complex structures, ultimately reaching the multiverse, a theoretical concept that encompasses many possible universes with their unique properties.
