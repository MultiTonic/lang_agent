 Result: I am not entirely sure I understand your question, but if you are asking for a description of a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and universe of universes using the languages OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq, then here is one possible ordering using Variant Number 1:

1. OCaml typerepresenting the universe of types in OCaml. This could be the `type` keyword in OCaml, which represents a simple type. For example:
```ocaml
type t = int
```
2. Coq typerepresenting the universe of types in Coq. This could be the `Type` keyword in Coq, which represents a universe of types. For example:
```coq
Inductive Type : Type.
```
3. MetaCoq typerepresenting the universe of types in MetaCoq. This could be the `type` keyword in MetaCoq, which represents a type in the logical framework used by MetaCoq. For example:
```metacoq
type ('a, 'b) eq = ...
```
4. OCaml universe of typerepresenting a universe of types in OCaml. This could be a functor that takes a module representing a universe of types and returns a new module representing a larger universe of types. For example:
```ocaml
module type S = sig
  type t
end

module Make (U : S) : S with type t = U.t list = struct
  type t = U.t list
end
```
5. Coq universe of typerepresenting a universe of types in Coq. This could be an inductive type that takes a universe of types and returns a new universe of types. For example:
```coq
Inductive TypeU : Type -> Type :=
| TypeT : forall U, TypeU (TypeU U)
| Type1 : Type -> TypeU (TypeU Type).
```
6. MetaCoq universe of typerepresenting a universe of types in MetaCoq. This could be a type constructor that takes a universe of types and returns a new universe of types. For example:
```metacoq
type ('a, 'b) ueq = ...

type ('a, 'b) u : Type -> Type -> Type :=
| UTt : ('a, 'b) ueq -> ('a, 'b) u Type Type
| U1  : ('a, 'b) ueq -> ('a, 'b) u Type (UTt eq).
```
7. OCaml universe of universesof typerepresenting a universe of universes in OCaml. This could be a functor that takes a module representing a universe of types and returns a new module representing a larger universe of universes of types. For example:
```ocaml
module type S = sig
  type t
end

module Make (U : S) : S with type t = U.t list * U.t list = struct
  type t = U.t list * U.t list
end
```
8. Coq universe of universesof typerepresenting a universe of universes of types in Coq. This could be an inductive type that takes a universe of types and returns a new universe of universes of types. For example:
```coq
Inductive TypeUU : Type -> Type :=
| TypeUUT : forall U, TypeUU (TypeUU U)
| TypeU1  : forall U, TypeUU (TypeUU (TypeUU U)).
```
9. MetaCoq universe of universesof typerepresenting a universe of universes of types in MetaCoq. This could be a type constructor that takes a universe of types and returns a new universe of universes of types. For example:
```metacoq
type ('a, 'b) uu : Type -> Type -> Type :=
| UUTt : ('a, 'b) ueq -> ('a, 'b) uu Type (UUTt eq)
| UU1   : ('a, 'b) ueq -> ('a, 'b) uu Type (UU1 eq).
```
This ordering is just one possible way to describe the universe and universe of universes using OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq. There are many other ways to do this, and the best approach will depend on the specific use case and the desired level of abstraction.
