 Result: I'm afraid there seems to be some confusion in your question. I'll do my best to provide a coherent answer, but I would appreciate it if you could clarify or rephrase your question if possible.

When describing the universe and a "universe of universes" (also known as a multiverse or a collection of universes), there are many different ways to order or categorize them, depending on the specific context and framework being used. Here's one possible way to describe a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 1:

1. The physical universe: This is the observable universe that we are familiar with, consisting of galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy. It can be described using various scientific theories and models, such as general relativity and the standard model of particle physics.
2. The multiverse: This is a collection or ensemble of universes, each with its own set of fields, particles, interactions, and properties. The multiverse can be divided into several sub-categories, depending on the specific framework being used. Here are a few possible examples:
* Bubble universes: These are universes that arise from the process of bubble nucleation during inflation in the early universe. Each bubble universe has its own set of fields and interactions, and may have different properties than our own universe.
* Brane universes: These are universes that exist on higher-dimensional objects known as branes. Our own universe may be just one of many branes in a larger multiverse, with each brane having its own set of fields and interactions.
* Mathematical universes: These are universes that can be described using mathematical structures and concepts. They may not correspond to any physical reality, but they can provide useful insights and frameworks for understanding the nature of our own universe.
1. The landscape: This is a concept in string theory that describes a vast space of possible vacuum solutions, each corresponding to a different universe with its own set of fields, particles, interactions, and properties. The landscape can be thought of as a "universe of universes," with each vacuum solution representing a different point in the space of possibilities.
2. Ultimate reality: This is the underlying reality that gives rise to all other types of universes and structures. It may be described using various philosophical or theoretical frameworks, such as Platonism, idealism, or string theory. The nature of ultimate reality is still a topic of active research and debate in philosophy and physics.

I hope this answers your question! If you have any further clarifications or follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
