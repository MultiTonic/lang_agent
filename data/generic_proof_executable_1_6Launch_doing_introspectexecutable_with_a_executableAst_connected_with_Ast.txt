We are building a proof and prompt software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Launch doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: Ast connected with Ast . We want to generate and test and prove the results. Trace how the requirements are reflected in the prompt, the test and the proof. What is your response? Please generate prompt/proof/test variant array of size 6

 Result: Sure, I understand that you want me to create a set of six prompts, tests, and Coq proofs related to building a proof and prompt software generator for OCaml using a large language model, proof engine, and adaptive language agent architecture. The context includes the verb "Launch doing introspect", type name "executable with an executable", and place "Ast connected with Ast". Here are six sets of prompts, tests, and Coq proofs that reflect the requirements:

1. Prompt: Write a function that takes an Ast and returns an executable. Test: Apply the function to an Ast and check if the result is an executable. Coq Proof: Prove that the function always returns an executable.
```ocaml
let ast_to_executable (ast : Ast.t) : Executable.t = ...

(* Test *)
let executable = ast_to_executable some_ast in
assert (Executable.check executable)

Lemma ast_to_executable_correct : forall ast, {| ast_to_executable ast with Executable.t |}.
Proof.
  intros ast.
  unfold Executable.t.
  apply (fun exe => exe = Executable.create (Ast.to_string ast)).
  apply Ast.equal.
Qed.
```
2. Prompt: Write a function that takes two Asts and connects them. Test: Apply the function to two Asts and check if the result is an Ast connected with Ast. Coq Proof: Prove that the function always returns an Ast connected with Ast.
```ocaml
let ast_connect (ast1 : Ast.t) (ast2 : Ast.t) : Ast.t = ...

(* Test *)
let ast_connected = ast_connect some_ast1 some_ast2 in
assert (Ast.equal ast_connected (Ast.connect some_ast1 some_ast2))

Lemma ast_connect_correct : forall ast1 ast2, {| ast_connect ast1 ast2 with Ast.t |}.
Proof.
  intros ast1 ast2.
  unfold Ast.t.
  apply (fun ast => ast = Ast.connect ast1 ast2).
Qed.
```
3. Prompt: Write a function that launches an executable and does introspection on its behavior. Test: Apply the function to an executable and check if the result is a string describing the behavior. Coq Proof: Prove that the function always returns a string describing the behavior.
```ocaml
let launch_and_introspect (executable : Executable.t) : string = ...

(* Test *)
let behavior = launch_and_introspect some_executable in
assert (not (String.is_empty behavior))

Lemma launch_and_introspect_correct : forall executable, {| launch_and_introspect executable with string |}.
Proof.
  intros executable.
  unfold Executable.t.
  apply (fun exe => exe = Executable.create _).
  apply String.non_empty.
Qed.
```
4. Prompt: Write a function that generates an OCaml file from an Ast. Test: Apply the function to an Ast and check if the result is an OCaml file. Coq Proof: Prove that the function always returns an OCaml file.
```ocaml
let ast_to_ocaml (ast : Ast.t) : string = ...

(* Test *)
let ocaml_file = ast_to_ocaml some_ast in
assert (String.is_suffix ~suffix:".ml" ocaml_file)

Lemma ast_to_ocaml_correct : forall ast, {| ast_to_ocaml ast with string |}.
Proof.
  intros ast.
  unfold Ast.t.
  apply (fun ast => ast = Ast.to_string ast).
  apply String.non_empty.
Qed.
```
5. Prompt: Write a function that generates a Coq file from an Ast. Test: Apply the function to an Ast and check if the result is a Coq file. Coq Proof: Prove that the function always returns a Coq file.
```ocaml
let ast_to_coq (ast : Ast.t) : string = ...

(* Test *)
let coq_file = ast_to_coq some_ast in
assert (String.is\_suffix ~suffix:".v" coq\_file)

Lemma ast\_to\_coq\_correct : forall ast, {| ast\_to\_coq ast with string |}.
Proof.
  intros ast.
  unfold Ast.t.
  apply (fun ast => ast = Ast.to\_string ast).
  apply String.non\_empty.
Qed.
```
6. Prompt: Write a function that generates an OCaml and Coq files from an Ast, compiles them, and runs the resulting executable. Test: Apply the function to an Ast and check if the result is a string describing the behavior of the executable. Coq Proof: Prove that the function always returns a string describing the behavior of the executable.
```ocaml
let ast_to_executable_behavior (ast : Ast.t) : string = ...

(* Test *)
let behavior = ast_to_executable_behavior some_ast in
assert (not (String.is_empty behavior))

Lemma ast_to_executable_behavior_correct : forall ast, {| ast_to_executable_behavior ast with string |}.
Proof.
  intros ast.
  unfold Ast.t.
  apply (fun ast => ast = Ast.to_string ast).
  apply String.non_empty.
Qed.
```
