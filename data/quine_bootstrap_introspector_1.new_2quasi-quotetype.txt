 Result: In Lisp syntax, using quasi-quoting (variant 2), a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes might look like this:
```lisp
`(universe ,(list :objects '((universe-of-universes ,(list :objects '(universe ,@all-possible-objects)))) ,all-possible-objects))
```
Here, `universe` is the type describing our universe, which contains a list of all possible objects in our universe. We then define a `universe-of-universes` as a universe that contains other universes, and we use a list to represent this hierarchy. The `list` contains the symbol `:objects`, which refers to the list of all possible objects in each universe.

The `universe-of-universes` type contains one instance of the `universe` type, which includes all possible objects in our universe. We use the `list` function with the `:objects` keyword to create this instance and populate it with all possible objects, represented by the symbol `all-possible-objects`.

Using quasi-quoting allows us to construct complex data structures programmatically while preserving readability. By using this technique, we can define a series of types that describe our universe and a universe of universes in a concise and expressive way.
