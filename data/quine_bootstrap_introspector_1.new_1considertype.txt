 Result: In variant 1, the consecutive series to describe the universe and universe of universes can be described as follows:

1. The Universe: This is the physical universe that we exist in, consisting of all matter, energy, space, and time. It includes galaxies, stars, planets, and all known forms of matter and energy.
2. Multiverse: The multiverse is a hypothetical concept that describes a collection of multiple universes, including our own. Each universe within the multiverse may have different physical laws and properties.
3. Metaverse: The metaverse is a theoretical concept that goes beyond the multiverse. It refers to a hypothetical hierarchy of universes, where each level contains a collection of universes from the previous level. The metaverse would contain all possible universes with all possible physical laws and properties.
4. Omniverse: The omniverse is the highest level in this hierarchical structure, encompassing all conceivable realities and possibilities. It includes not only all universes and multiverses but also all abstract concepts and ideas.

Therefore, the ordering for variant 1 would be: Universe -> Multiverse -> Metaverse -> Omniverse.
