 Result: Variant 1: Using a hierarchical structure to describe the universe and universe of universes (multiverse)

1. The physical universe: This includes all matter, energy, space, and time that exist in our observable and unobservable universe. It is governed by laws of physics and can be further divided into subcategories such as galaxies, stars, planets, and life forms.
2. The mathematical universe: This includes all possible mathematical structures, concepts, and relationships. It is a platonic realm of abstract entities that exist independently of the physical universe.
3. The conceptual universe: This includes all ideas, meanings, symbols, languages, and cultures that humans create and communicate. It is a mental and social construct that reflects our cognitive and social capacities.
4. The virtual universe: This includes all simulated or virtual worlds, environments, or systems that are created by technology or imagination. It can range from simple video games to complex computer models or digital twins of reality.
5. The possible universe: This includes all logically consistent scenarios, stories, or thought experiments that are not actualized in our physical universe but could be in other universes or multiverses. It is a realm of possibility and potentiality that transcends our current knowledge and experience.
6. The ultimate universe: This includes all possible universes, multiverses, or metaverses that exist or could exist, regardless of their nature or properties. It is a hypothetical concept that encompasses all reality and beyond.

This hierarchical structure reflects a progression from the concrete to the abstract, from the actual to the potential, and from the finite to the infinite. It also highlights the interconnections and interactions between different domains of knowledge and experience, as well as the limitations and uncertainties of our understanding of the universe and multiverse.
