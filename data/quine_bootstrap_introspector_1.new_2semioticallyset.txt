 Result: I'm assuming that by "semiotically" you mean using signs and symbols to represent concepts. In this case, I will provide a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and the universe of universes (multiverse) using Variant 2.

1. Set: Physical Universe
	* Subset: Galaxies
		+ Subset: Milky Way
			- Subset: Solar System
				* Subset: Earth
				* Subset: Other Planets
	* Subset: Other Galaxies
2. Set: Abstract Concepts
	* Subset: Time
		+ Subset: Past
		+ Subset: Present
		+ Subset: Future
	* Subset: Space
		+ Subset: Three-dimensional space
		+ Subset: Higher-dimensional space
	* Subset: Energy
		+ Subset: Kinetic energy
		+ Subset: Potential energy
	* Subset: Matter
		+ Subset: Solid
		+ Subset: Liquid
		+ Subset: Gas
		+ Subset: Plasma
3. Set: Multiverse
	* Subset: Universes with similar properties to our own
	* Subset: Universes with different properties
	* Subset: Parallel universes or alternate realities
	* Subset: Universes with different dimensions
	* Subset: Universes with different fundamental laws of physics.
