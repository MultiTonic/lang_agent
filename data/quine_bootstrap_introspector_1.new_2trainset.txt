 Result: To create a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse), we can start with set theory basics and gradually expand to more complex concepts. Here's one possible ordering using Variant 2:

1. Set: An unordered collection of unique elements, often denoted by curly braces {}. Example: {1, 2, 3}
2. Subset: A set containing some or all elements of another set. Example: {1, 2} is a subset of {1, 2, 3}
3. Union: The union of two sets contains all the distinct elements from both sets. Example: A ∪ B (where A = {1, 2}, B = {2, 3}) = {1, 2, 3}
4. Intersection: The intersection of two sets contains only the common elements. Example: A ∩ B (where A = {1, 2}, B = {2, 3}) = {2}
5. Complement: The complement of a set contains all elements not in that set. Example: A' (where A = {1, 2}) = {3, 4, 5, ...}
6. Ordered pair: A list of two elements in a specific order, denoted as (a, b). Example: (1, 2) ≠ (2, 1)
7. Relation: A set of ordered pairs that satisfies a rule or condition. Example: The relation "less than" for numbers, R = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), ...}
8. Function: A special type of relation where each input has exactly one output. Example: f(x) = x^2
9. Set of sets: A set whose elements are other sets. Example: {{{1}, {2}}, {{1, 2}}}
10. Universe (U): The universal set containing all elements under consideration.
11. Power set: The set of all possible subsets of a given set. Example: P({1, 2}) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}
12. Cartesian product: The set of all ordered pairs formed by combining elements from two sets. Example: A x B (where A = {1, 2}, B = {3, 4}) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}
13. Relation on a Cartesian product: A relation defined on the set of all ordered pairs from two sets. Example: The relation "is a sibling to" on the set {(John, Mary), (John, James), (Mary, John), ...}
14. Multiverse (M): A collection of distinct universes. Each universe in M can contain different elements and relationships.

This progression moves from foundational concepts to more complex structures that can describe both the universe and a multiverse.
