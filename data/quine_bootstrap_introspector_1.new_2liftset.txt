 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here is a possible way to lift a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 2:

1. The first set in our series could be the set of all physical particles in the universe, such as electrons, quarks, and photons. This set would include every particle that exists within our universe.
2. The second set in our series could be the set of all fields in the universe, such as gravitational fields, electromagnetic fields, and strong and weak nuclear forces. This set would include every field that exists within our universe.
3. The third set in our series could be the set of all galaxies in the universe. This set would include every galaxy that exists within our universe, from small dwarf galaxies to massive elliptical galaxies.
4. The fourth set in our series could be the set of all clusters and superclusters of galaxies in the universe. This set would include every cluster and supercluster that exists within our universe, such as the Virgo Cluster and the Laniakea Supercluster.
5. The fifth set in our series could be the set of all universes in the multiverse, also known as the "multiverse." This set would include every universe that exists, each with its own sets of particles, fields, galaxies, and structures.
6. The sixth set in our series could be the set of all possible properties and configurations that a universe can have, such as different laws of physics, different shapes, and different dimensions. This set would include every possible way that a universe could exist.
7. The seventh and final set in our series could be the set of all concepts and abstractions that we use to describe and understand the universe and the multiverse, such as mathematics, logic, and language. This set would include every tool that we have at our disposal to make sense of the cosmos.

Using this ordering, we can see how each set builds upon the previous one, moving from the concrete and particular (physical particles and fields) to the abstract and general (concepts and abstractions). This allows us to describe not only our own universe, but also a whole "universe of universes," with all its possible properties and configurations.
