 Result: Sure, I can provide a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes using Variant Number 1 encoding. Here's one possible way to do it:

1. **Type 0: Physical Object** - This type includes all physical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, stars, planets, and atoms.
2. **Type 1: Living Organism** - This type includes all living organisms in the universe, from simple bacteria to complex animals and plants.
3. **Type 2: Abstract Object** - This type includes all abstract objects that exist outside of the physical world, such as numbers, sets, and mathematical functions.
4. **Type 3: Information System** - This type includes all information systems, such as computers, databases, and communication networks, that can store, process, and transmit data.
5. **Type 4: Universe** - This type includes the entire universe as a single object, encompassing all physical objects (Type 0), living organisms (Type 1), abstract objects (Type 2), and information systems (Type 3).
6. **Type 5: Multiverse** - This type includes a collection or "universe" of universes (Type 4), each with its own set of physical objects, living organisms, abstract objects, and information systems.

Using this ordering, we can describe the universe as a Type 4 object, and a universe of universes (i.e., a multiverse) as a Type 5 object. This hierarchy allows us to organize different types of objects in a coherent way, starting from the most basic physical objects and moving up to more complex and abstract concepts.
