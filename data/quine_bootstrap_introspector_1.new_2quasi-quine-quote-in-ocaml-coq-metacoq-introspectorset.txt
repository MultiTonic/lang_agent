 Result: In the context of the "universe and universe of universes" in Coq, there are several layers of objects involved:

1. **Small types** - these are basic types such as `nat`, `bool`, etc. They are part of the first or "smallest" universe level.
2. **Large types** - these include things like functions from small types to other small types, and are part of a larger universe level than small types.
3. **Type universes** - Coq has a hierarchy of type universes, each containing smaller universes. For example, `Type 0` is the smallest universe, which contains all the small and large types mentioned above. `Type 1` is the next universe up, which contains `Type 0`, and so on.
4. **Kinds** - In Coq's type theory, kinds are a level above universes. They represent "collections of universes" and include things like `Set`, `Prop`, and `Type`. The kind `Set` is the smallest kind, which contains the universe `Type 0`.

Given this hierarchy, here is one possible ordering for a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and universe of universes in Coq:

1. Small types (e.g., `nat`, `bool`) - These are part of the smallest universe level, `Type 0`.
2. Large types (e.g., functions from small types to other small types) - Also part of the first universe level, `Type 0`.
3. The rest of the universes in order (`Type 1`, `Type 2`, etc.) - These contain higher and higher levels of types and kinds.
4. The kind `Set` - This is the smallest kind, which contains all the universes up to this point.
5. The kind `Prop` - This is a slightly larger kind that contains only "propositions" (types whose inhabitants can be proven or disproven). It includes the `Prop` types from each universe level.
6. The kind `Type` - This is the largest kind, which contains all of Coq's types.

Note that this is just one possible ordering, and there are other ways to structure the universe hierarchy in Coq.
