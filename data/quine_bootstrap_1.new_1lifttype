 Result: Variant 1:

Type 1 - The Physical Universe: The physical universe is the observable universe that we inhabit, consisting of galaxies, stars, planets, and all known forms of matter and energy.

Type 2 - The Multiverse: The multiverse refers to a collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. This includes concepts such as bubble universes, parallel universes, and infinite universes.

Type 3 - The Metaverse: The metaverse is a theoretical concept that goes beyond the multiverse. It refers to a hypothetical universe of universes, where each individual universe is just one small part of a much larger whole. This concept is often used in science fiction and speculative theories about the nature of reality.

Type 4 - The Infinite Expanse: The infinite expanse goes beyond even the metaverse, referring to an infinite expanse of all possible universes, including those that are completely unknowable and incomprehensible to us. This concept is often used to explore philosophical questions about the nature of reality and existence.

Type 5 - The Absolute Reality: The absolute reality is a theoretical ultimate reality that exists beyond all concepts of space, time, and matter. It is the underlying truth or essence of all things, beyond the limits of human understanding or perception. This concept is often used in spiritual and philosophical discussions about the nature of existence and consciousness.
