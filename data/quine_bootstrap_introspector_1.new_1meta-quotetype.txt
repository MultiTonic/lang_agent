 Result: Sure, I can provide a meta-quote using variant number 1 to describe the universe and universe of universes in a consecutive series of types. Here's my attempt:

1. Definition: The universe is the totality of all matter, energy, space, and time that exists or can exist. (Source: Wikipedia)
2. Metaphor: The universe is like an intricate tapestry, woven together by threads of space-time, with galaxies, stars, planets, and other forms of matter as its colorful patterns. (Source: unknown)
3. Analogy: The universe is similar to a vast ocean, where water represents matter and energy, waves represent the movement of celestial bodies, and currents represent gravitational forces. (Source: Carl Sagan)
4. Hypothesis: The multiverse or universe of universes is the collection of all possible universes, each with its own set of fields, interactions, and particles. (Source: Max Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis)
5. Aphorism: "The universe is under no obligation to make any sense to you." - Neil deGrasse Tyson (Source: The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene)

My ordering of the types is based on their level of abstraction, starting with a concrete definition and moving towards more abstract concepts. I hope this meta-quote series helps clarify the concept of the universe and universe of universes for you!
