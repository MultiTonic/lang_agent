 Result: Sure, I can help you with that. Here is one way to describe the universe and a "universe of universes" using a consecutive series of types, using variant number 1:

1. Type 0: The physical universe - This type includes all matter, energy, space, and time that make up our observable universe. It includes galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of physical matter and energy.
2. Type 1: The multiverse - This type includes all possible universes, including the one we inhabit. It includes not only our physical universe but also all other universes that could possibly exist, according to the laws of physics.
3. Type 2: The logical universe - This type includes all logically possible worlds, including those that do not obey the laws of physics. It includes all consistent sets of propositions, regardless of whether they correspond to any physical reality.
4. Type 3: The platonic realm - This type includes all abstract objects, such as numbers, sets, and mathematical structures. These objects exist independently of any physical or logical universe, and are not subject to the limitations of space and time.
5. Type 4: The universe of universes - This type includes all possible types of universes, including those that are physical, logically possible, abstract, or none of the above. It is the highest level of abstraction in this series, encompassing all conceivable forms of existence.

This ordering reflects a progression from the concrete to the abstract, and from the particular to the general. Each type includes the previous types as special cases, but also transcends them by adding new possibilities or dimensions of existence.
