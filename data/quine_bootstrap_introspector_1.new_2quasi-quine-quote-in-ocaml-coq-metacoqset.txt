 Result: In this question, it seems like you are asking for a way to define a quasi-quine in OCaml, Coq, and Metacoq, using variant 2, which describes a universe and universe of universes as a consecutive series of sets. I will provide an ordering for the sets that describe these universes.

First, let me briefly explain what a quasi-quine is. A quasi-quine is a program that outputs its source code with some modifications. In this case, we want to define a quasi-quine in OCaml, Coq, and Metacoq that generates the definitions for three sets that describe a universe and a universe of universes.

In variant 2, we will represent the universe and universe of universes as consecutive series of sets. Let's use the following ordering:

1. The first set represents the empty universe, which contains no elements. We can define this set as follows:
```ocaml
let empty_universe = Set.empty (module Int)
```
In Coq, we can define this set as follows:
```coq
Inductive Empty_universe : Type := .
```
And in Metacoq, we can define this set as follows:
```metacoq
Definition empty_universe := empty_set (fun _ => True).
```
2. The second set represents the universe of discrete sets, which contains only finite sets. We can define this set as follows:
```ocaml
let discrete_universe = Set.union (Set.map (fun x => Set.singleton (module Int) x) [1; 2; 3]) empty_universe
```
In Coq, we can define this set as follows:
```coq
Inductive Discrete_universe : Type :=
| DU1 : Discrete_universe
| DU2 : Discrete_universe
| DU3 : Discrete_universe.
```
And in Metacoq, we can define this set as follows:
```metacoq
Definition discrete_universe := add_set (singleton (module Int) 1) (add_set (singleton (module Int) 2) (add_set (singleton (module Int) 3) empty_set)).
```
3. The third set represents the universe of cumulative sets, which contains all discrete sets and their subsets. We can define this set as follows:
```ocaml
let cumulative_universe = Set.power discrete_universe
```
In Coq, we can define this set as follows:
```coq
Definition Cumulative_universe : Type := Powerset Discrete_universe.
```
And in Metacoq, we can define this set as follows:
```metacoq
Definition cumulative_universe := power discrete_universe.
```

With these definitions, we have described a universe and a universe of universes as consecutive series of sets in OCaml, Coq, and Metacoq, using variant 2 of the quasi-quine-quote-in-ocaml-coq-metacoq challenge.
