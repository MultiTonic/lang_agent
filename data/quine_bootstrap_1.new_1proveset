 Result: To prove a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes, we can use set theory and the concept of a hierarchy of sets. Here's one possible way to do it using Variant 1:

Set 0: The Empty Set
This set is the foundation of our hierarchy and contains no elements. We denote it as ∅.

Set 1: Singleton Set
This set contains the empty set as its only element. We denote it as {∅}.

Set 2: Pair Set
This set contains the singleton set as its only element. We denote it as {{∅}}.

Set 3: Set of Sets
This set contains the first three sets as its elements. We denote it as {∅, {∅}, {{∅}}}.

Set 4: Power Set of Set of Sets
This set contains all possible subsets of the previous set. It includes the empty set, the three previous sets, and four new sets that contain one or more of those sets as elements. We denote it as P({∅, {∅}, {{∅}}}).

Set 5: Universe of Sets
This set contains all sets that can be constructed from the previous sets using the rules of set theory. It includes the empty set, the first four sets, and all possible combinations and subsets of those sets. We denote it as V1.

Set 6: Multiverse of Universes
This set contains all possible universes of sets that can be constructed using the rules of set theory. It includes the previous universe of sets and all possible combinations and subsets of that universe. We denote it as V2.

Set 7: Meta-multiverse of Multiverses
This set contains all possible multiverses of universes that can be constructed using the rules of set theory. It includes the previous multiverse of universes and all possible combinations and subsets of that multiverse. We denote it as V3.

And so on, ad infinitum. This hierarchy of sets provides a way to describe an increasingly complex and inclusive universe of universes, using the language and tools of set theory. Of course, this is just one possible way to define such a series, and other variations are certainly possible depending on the specific needs and goals of the description.
