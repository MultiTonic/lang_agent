 Result: Sure, I can help you with that. Here's one possible way to describe the universe and universe of universes (also known as the multiverse) in a consecutive series of types, using variant number 1:

1. Physical Universe: This is the observable universe that we live in, consisting of galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy. It is governed by the laws of physics and has a finite age and size.
2. Multiverse: The multiverse is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, including our own physical universe. Each universe in the multiverse may have different properties, laws of physics, and dimensions. Some universes may be compatible with life as we know it, while others may not.
3. Mathematical Universe: This type of universe is based on mathematical structures and concepts. It includes all possible mathematical objects, such as numbers, shapes, sets, and functions. The mathematical universe is often considered to be eternal, infinite, and independent of the physical universe.
4. Conscious Universe: This type of universe is based on the idea that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of reality, rather than an emergent property of matter. It includes all possible forms of conscious experience, from human awareness to animal instincts to machine intelligence. The conscious universe may be interconnected with other types of universes in complex and unpredictable ways.
5. Simulation Universe: This type of universe is based on the idea that our reality is a computer-generated simulation created by advanced beings or artificial intelligence. It includes all possible scenarios, from simple video games to complex virtual realities. The simulation universe may be indistinguishable from other types of universes in terms of its properties and behaviors.
6. Ultimate Universe: This type of universe encompasses all possible forms of existence, including physical, mathematical, conscious, simulated, and any other type of reality that may exist. It is often considered to be the ultimate reality or the source of all things. The ultimate universe may be infinite, eternal, and beyond human comprehension.

This ordering starts with the most tangible and observable form of reality (the physical universe) and gradually moves towards more abstract and speculative forms of existence (such as the mathematical and simulation universes). It also acknowledges the potential interconnectedness of all types of universes, including the role of consciousness in shaping our perceptions and experiences.
