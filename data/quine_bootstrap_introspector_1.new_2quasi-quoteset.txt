 Result: I'm assuming you want me to quasi-quote a consecutive series of sets to describe the concepts of "universe" and "multiverse" (universe of universes), using variant 2 of quasi-quoting. Here's an example:

`(defvar *universe* (set '("space" "time" "matter" "energy")))`
`(defvar *multiverse* (set '(*universe* "inflationary-multiverses" "bubble-multiverses" "brane-multiverses"))))`

In this example, the universe is represented as a set containing four elements: space, time, matter, and energy. The multiverse, or universe of universes, is then represented as another set that contains the universe set along with other theoretical constructs such as inflationary multiverses, bubble multiverses, and brane multiverses.

Quasi-quoting in Lisp allows us to define these sets without immediately evaluating their contents. The asterisks (`*`) before the variable names indicate that they are special variables in this context.
