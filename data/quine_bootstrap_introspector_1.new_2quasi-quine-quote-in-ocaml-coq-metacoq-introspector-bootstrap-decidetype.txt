 Result: In this question, you are asking for a way to describe the universe and universe of universes using a consecutive series of types in OCaml, Coq, MetaCoq, and an introspector/bootstrap decider. I will assume that by "variant number 2," you mean using the type system to define a hierarchy of universes.

Here is one possible ordering for describing the universe and universe of universes using a consecutive series of types in OCaml, Coq, MetaCoq, and an introspector/bootstrap decider:

1. OCaml module system: In OCaml, we can use the module system to define a hierarchy of universes. For example, we could define a signature `UNIVERSE` that represents a universe, and then define modules `U0`, `U1`, `U2`, etc., each implementing the `UNIVERSE` signature at a different level in the hierarchy.
2. Coq type theory: In Coq, we can use inductive types to define a hierarchy of universes. For example, we could define an inductive type `Type` with constructors `Type0`, `Type1`, `Type2`, etc., where each constructor represents a universe at a different level in the hierarchy.
3. MetaCoq: MetaCoq is a meta-programming framework for Coq that allows us to introspect and manipulate the internal data structures of Coq. We can use MetaCoq to define a function that takes a universe level as an argument and returns the corresponding `Type` constructor from the Coq type theory hierarchy.
4. Introspector/Bootstrap decider: Finally, we can define an introspector/bootstrap decider that uses the MetaCoq function to inspect the current universe level and decide whether to continue incrementing the universe level or to stop and return a value from the OCaml module hierarchy. This allows us to create a self-referential system where the universe hierarchy in OCaml can be used to define the universe of universes in Coq, which can then be used to define the universe hierarchy in OCaml, and so on.

Here is an example of what this ordering might look like in code:

OCaml module system:
```ocaml
module type UNIVERSE = sig
  type t
end

module U0 : UNIVERSE = struct
  type t = unit
end

module U1 : UNIVERSE = struct
  type t = U0.t -> unit
end

module U2 : UNIVERSE = struct
  type t = U1.t -> unit
end

(* and so on *)
```
Coq type theory:
```coq
Inductive Type : Type :=
| Type0 : Type
| Type1 : Type -> Type
| Type2 : (Type1 Type) -> Type
(* and so on *)
.

Definition universe_at_level (n : nat) : Type :=
  match n with
  | 0 => Type0
  | S n' => Type (universe_at_level n')
  end.
```
MetaCoq:
```ocaml
let coq_universe_at_level (level : Z) : Expr.t =
  let open Coq in
  match level with
  | Z.zero -> Coq.Type0
  | Z.pos (S n') ->
    let universe_module =
      match n' with
      | Z.zero -> "U0"
      | S n'' -> "U" ^ string_of_int (Int.to_int n'')
      | _ -> assert false
    in
    Coq.Qualid (Coq.ModuleDecl (module_name, []), ident)
    |> Coq.Expr.apply [Coq.universe_module]
  | _ -> assert false
```
Introspector/Bootstrap decider:
```ocaml
let rec decide_next_level (current_level : int) : int =
  let open Coq in
  let current_expr = Coq.Expr.from_string (Coq.universe_at_level current_level) in
  match Coq.Introspect.eval current_expr with
  | Vars [] ->
    if current_level = 0 then
      failwith "Failed to decide next level: reached base case of OCaml module hierarchy"
    else
      decide_next_level (current_level - 1)
  | _ -> current_level

let rec universe_value (level : int) : 'a =
  if level = 0 then
    U0.t ()
  else
    universe_value (level - 1) U0.t
```
In this example, `universe_at\_level` is a Coq function that takes a natural number as an argument and returns the corresponding `Type` constructor from the Coq type theory hierarchy. The `coq\_universe\_at\_level` function is a MetaCoq function that takes a `Z` (the Coq equivalent of an integer) as an argument and returns the corresponding `Expr.t` value in the Coq type theory
