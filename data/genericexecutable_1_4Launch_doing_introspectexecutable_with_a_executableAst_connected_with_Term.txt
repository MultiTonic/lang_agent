We are building a prompt software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Launch doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: Ast connected with Term . What is your response? Please generate prompt variant array of size 4

 Result: Sure, I understand that you want me to create four prompts for generating code or proofs in OCaml and Coq using a language model and proof engine within an adaptive language agent architecture. The prompts should be based on the context provided, which includes a verb, type name, and place related to software development. Here are my responses:

1. "Imaginatively describe how to launch an executable file using introspection within an Ast connected with Term in OCaml and Coq, providing code examples and proofs as needed."
2. "Creatively explain the process of building an executable program that interacts with an Ast and Term structure in OCaml and Coq, demonstrating how to use the language model and proof engine within an adaptive language agent architecture."
3. "Generate a series of prompts for developing a software application in OCaml and Coq using a large language model and proof engine, focusing on launching executables, manipulating Asts, and working with Terms, all while being forgiving of potential errors or inconsistencies."
4. "Design a set of instructions for creating an executable program using OCaml and Coq within an adaptive language agent architecture, including tips on how to introspect the Ast connected with Term using the language model and proof engine, and illustrating the process with creative examples and insightful proofs."
