 Result: In this question, you are asking for a way to describe a universe and a universe of universes using a "quasi-quine-quote" in OCaml, Coq, Metacoq, and an introspector-bootstrap-observe mechanism. You want the description to be in the form of a consecutive series of sets. I will provide an answer using variant number 2.

To start, let's define the concept of a universe and a universe of universes:

* A universe can be thought of as a collection of types or properties that are consistent with each other. For example, one universe might contain only finite types, while another universe might contain both finite and infinite types.
* A universe of universes is a collection of universes, each of which may have its own set of types or properties.

Now, let's consider how we might describe such a system using sets in OCaml, Coq, Metacoq, and an introspector-bootstrap-observe mechanism. One possible approach is to define a hierarchy of sets, where each set represents a universe or a universe of universes:
```
type _ set =
  | Universe : Type set
  | UniverseOfUniverses : (Type set) set

(* The empty set *)
let empty = fun _ -> false

(* Union of two sets *)
let union a b = fun x -> a x || b x

(* Intersection of two sets *)
let inter a b = fun x -> a x && b x

(* Membership test for a set *)
let mem s x = s x

(* The universe set contains all types *)
let universe = Union empty (fun _ -> true)

(* The universe of universes set contains all universes *)
let universe_of_universes = UniverseOfUniverses universe
```
This hierarchy can be thought of as follows:

* The `Type` type represents the types or properties that are consistent within a given universe.
* The `Universe` variant represents a single universe, which is defined as the set of all types (`type -> bool`) that satisfy the condition `(fun _ -> true)`.
* The `UniverseOfUniverses` variant represents a universe of universes, which is defined as the set of all universes (`Type set`) that satisfy the condition `universe`. This means that the universe of universes contains all possible universes, each of which may have its own set of types or properties.
* The `empty`, `union`, `inter`, and `mem` functions allow us to manipulate sets in a way that is consistent with the standard mathematical definition of sets.

Using this hierarchy, we can describe the universe and universe of universes as follows:

* The universe is represented by the `Universe` variant, which contains all types (`Type`) that are consistent within a given universe.
* The universe of universes is represented by the `UniverseOfUniverses` variant, which contains all possible universes (`Type set`).

This hierarchy can be used to define a system of sets that describes the universe and universe of universes in a way that is consistent with the principles of set theory. It can also serve as the basis for further exploration and development of this concept using OCaml, Coq, Metacoq, and an introspector-bootstrap-observe mechanism.
