 Result: Sure, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how you might describe the universe and a universe of universes using a consecutive series of types in Variant Number 2:

1. Physical Object: This type includes all physical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, stars, planets, and everything else that takes up space and has mass.
2. Galaxy: This type is a subtype of Physical Object and includes all galaxies, which are massive collections of stars, gas, and dust bound together by gravity.
3. Star: This type is a subtype of Physical Object and includes all stars, which are massive, luminous spheres of plasma held together by gravity.
4. Planet: This type is a subtype of Physical Object and includes all planets, which are celestial bodies orbiting a star or stellar remnant that are massive enough to be rounded by their own gravity, but not so massive as to cause thermonuclear fusion.
5. Multiverse: This type includes all universes, each of which may contain its own physical objects, galaxies, stars, and planets.
6. Universe: This type is a subtype of Multiverse and includes all the physical objects, galaxies, stars, and planets within a single universe.

Using this ordering, we can describe the universe as a Physical Object, which contains Galaxies, which in turn contain Stars, which may have Planets orbiting around them. We can then describe a Universe of Universes, or Multiverse, as a collection of multiple Universes, each containing its own Physical Objects, Galaxies, Stars, and Planets.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
