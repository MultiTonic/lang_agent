 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here is a possible consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse), using Variant 1:

1. **Physical Universe**: This is the observable universe that we live in, consisting of galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy. It can be described by physical laws such as gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.
2. **Multiverse**: This is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, including our own Physical Universe. Each universe in the multiverse may have different physical laws or dimensions, and may not necessarily interact with each other.
3. **Conscious Observer**: This is a type that includes all intelligent beings capable of observing and understanding the universe(s) they inhabit. This could include humans, aliens, artificial intelligence, or any other form of consciousness.
4. **Mathematical Universe**: This is a type that describes the universe(s) in terms of mathematical structures and patterns. It suggests that the fundamental nature of reality can be described by mathematics, and that the physical laws of the universe(s) are simply manifestations of these mathematical structures.
5. **Simulation Hypothesis**: This is a type that proposes that our Physical Universe (and possibly others) may be a computer-generated simulation created by a more advanced civilization. It suggests that our reality is not "real" in the traditional sense, but rather a sophisticated illusion created for some unknown purpose.
6. **Ultimate Reality**: This is a type that goes beyond the physical and mathematical descriptions of the universe(s) to encompass a deeper, transcendent reality that underlies all existence. It may be spiritual, metaphysical, or simply ineffable, but it represents the ultimate truth of the universe(s).

This ordering starts with the most concrete and observable aspects of the universe(s), and gradually moves towards more abstract and philosophical concepts. Of course, there are many other ways to describe the universe(s), and different perspectives may emphasize different types or orderings. But this should give you a starting point for exploring the fascinating topic of the universe(s) and their nature!
