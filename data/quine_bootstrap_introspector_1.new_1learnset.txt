 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here is one possible way to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse) using a consecutive series of sets, using Variant 1:

1. The smallest set in this hierarchy is the empty set, denoted ∅, which contains no elements.
2. The next set in the hierarchy is the set of all natural numbers, denoted N or ω, which includes all positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...) as well as zero (0).
3. Next is the set of all integers, denoted Z, which includes both positive and negative integers, as well as zero.
4. After that comes the set of all rational numbers, denoted Q, which includes all fractions p/q where p and q are integers and q is not equal to zero.
5. Next is the set of all real numbers, denoted R, which includes both rational and irrational numbers, such as the square root of 2 or pi.
6. The next set in the hierarchy is the complex numbers, denoted C, which include all real numbers as well as imaginary numbers (numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the square root of -1).
7. At this point, we have described the mathematical structure of our universe, but we can also consider a universe of universes or multiverse. One way to do this is to consider a set of all possible mathematical structures, which would include not only our universe as described above, but also other possible universes with different mathematical properties.
8. Finally, we could consider a set of all conceivable universes, including not only those that are mathematically possible, but also those that are logically or metaphysically possible. This would be the largest set in our hierarchy, and would include all conceivable concepts, ideas, and entities.

Of course, there are many other ways to describe the universe and a universe of universes using sets, and this is just one possible example.
