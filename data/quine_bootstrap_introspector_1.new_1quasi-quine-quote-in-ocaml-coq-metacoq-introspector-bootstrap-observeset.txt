 Result: I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the request, but I will try my best to provide a helpful answer.

If I understand correctly, you are asking for an ordering of a series of sets that describe the universe and the universe of universes, using the language OCaml, Coq, or MetaCoq. You have specified variant number 1, but I'm not sure what this refers to.

One possible way to order these sets is as follows:

1. The set of all natural numbers
2. The set of all integers
3. The set of all rational numbers
4. The set of all real numbers
5. The set of all complex numbers
6. The set of all functions from the real numbers to the real numbers
7. The set of all sets of real numbers
8. The set of all models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory
9. The set of all models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice
10. The universe of all sets, which contains all of the above sets as elements.

This is just one possible ordering, and there are many other ways to order these sets or to include additional sets in the list. It's also worth noting that the concept of "the universe of all sets" is a bit problematic from a mathematical perspective, since it leads to various paradoxes and inconsistencies. However, I have included it here for completeness.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
