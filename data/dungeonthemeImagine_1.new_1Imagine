 Result: I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding your question. Could you please rephrase or clarify what you are asking for?

To provide some context, when you mention "specify a theme in the country," it sounds like you may be asking about choosing a particular topic or focus to explore within a specific country. However, I'm not sure what you mean by "generate variant array of size 1."

If you could give me more information about what you are looking for, I would be happy to help!
