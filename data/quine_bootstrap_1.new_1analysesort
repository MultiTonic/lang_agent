 Result: I'm assuming that by "sort" you mean "story" or "theory." Here is an analysis of a consecutive series of stories to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using Variant Number 1.

Story 1: The Observable Universe
The first story in this series will focus on the observable universe, which is the part of the universe that we can directly observe and measure. This includes all matter and energy that we can detect with our instruments, such as telescopes and space probes. It also includes the cosmic background radiation, which is the residual heat left over from the Big Bang. The observable universe is estimated to be around 93 billion light-years in diameter.

Story 2: The Multiverse
The second story will explore the concept of the multiverse, which is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, including our own. Each universe in the multiverse would have its own set of matter, energy, space, and time, and they would not necessarily interact with each other. This idea is based on theories such as eternal inflation and the landscape vacuum solution in string theory.

Story 3: The Metaverse
The third story will delve into the concept of the metaverse, which is a hypothetical universe that contains all other universes, including our own observable universe and any possible multiverses. This idea is based on theories such as brane cosmology, which suggests that our universe may be just one of many branes (membranes) floating in a higher-dimensional space. The metaverse would be the ultimate container for all reality.

Story 4: Simulated Universes
The fourth story will consider the possibility that our universe is not "real" in the traditional sense, but rather a simulation created by a more advanced civilization. This idea has been popularized in recent years by scientists and philosophers such as Nick Bostrom and Neil deGrasse Tyson. If our universe is indeed a simulation, then it would be just one of many universes created by the simulators.

Story 5: The Ultimate Reality
The final story in this series will attempt to describe the ultimate reality that underlies all of these universes and simulations. This may be a concept such as God, the Singularity, or the Zero Point Field. It would represent the ultimate source of all existence, beyond time, space, and matter. This is, of course, purely speculative and cannot be proven or disproven with current scientific knowledge.

In summary, the ordering of this series of stories is as follows:

1. The Observable Universe
2. The Multiverse
3. The Metaverse
4. Simulated Universes
5. The Ultimate Reality
