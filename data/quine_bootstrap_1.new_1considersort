 Result: I'm assuming you are asking for a proposed ordering of concepts to describe the universe and a "universe of universes" (which could also be referred to as multiverse or metaverse). Here is one possible ordering using Variant 1:

1. The fundamental laws of physics, such as those governing energy, matter, and forces. These are the rules that govern how the universe operates at its most basic level.
2. Elementary particles, which are the building blocks of all matter in the universe. Examples include quarks, leptons, and photons.
3. Atoms, which are combinations of elementary particles. Atoms are the building blocks of matter that make up everything we can see and touch.
4. Stars, which are massive balls of hot gas that produce energy through nuclear fusion. They are the powerhouses of galaxies and are responsible for creating many of the elements necessary for life as we know it.
5. Planets, which are celestial bodies that orbit a star. They are made up of solid, liquid, or gaseous material and can support life in some cases.
6. Galaxies, which are vast collections of stars, gas, and dust held together by gravity. They come in many shapes and sizes, and our own Milky Way is just one example.
7. The universe itself, which is the sum total of all matter, energy, space, and time. It is thought to be infinite in size and constantly expanding.
8. A "universe of universes" (multiverse or metaverse), which is a collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of fundamental laws and properties. These universes may interact with one another in various ways, or they may be completely separate and distinct.

This ordering is just one possible way to describe the universe and a "universe of universes." There are many other concepts and phenomena that could also be included, depending on the context and level of detail desired.
