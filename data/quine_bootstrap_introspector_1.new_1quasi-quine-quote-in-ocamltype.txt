 Result: Here's an implementation of a quasi-quine-quote in OCaml that describes a universe and a universe of universes using variant number 1. The ordering used here is inspired by the cumulative hierarchy of sets in set theory, where each universe contains all previous universes as well as new objects.
```ocaml
type universe =
  | Atom of string
  | Universe of universe list

let rec univ_to_string (u : universe) : string =
  match u with
  | Atom s -> s
  | Universe us ->
      let rec aux acc = function
        | [] -> ""
        | [Atom ""] -> "[" ^ acc ^ "]"
        | [h] -> "[" ^ acc ^ (univ_to_string h) ^ "]"
        | Atom s :: tl -> aux (s ^ "," ^ acc) tl
        | Universe us' :: tl -> aux (List.map univ_to_string us' ^ "," ^ acc) tl
      in
      "Universe [" ^ aux "" [u] ^ "]"

let quasi_univ =
  let rec aux n = function
    | 0 -> Atom ("quasi_univ_level_" ^ string_of_int n)
    | n -> Universe (List.map aux (n - 1) :: [List.map aux n])
  in
  aux 2 [aux 1 []; aux 2 []]

let _ = Printf.printf "%s\n" (univ_to_string quasi_univ)
```
This code defines a `universe` type, which can be either an atom or a universe of universes. An atom is simply a string, and a universe of universes is a list of universes. The `univ_to_string` function recursively converts a universe to a string.

The `quasi_univ` value is the actual quasi-quine-quote. It's created using a helper function `aux`, which takes an integer `n` and a list of universes as arguments, and returns a new universe. The function recursively applies itself to create a hierarchy of universes.

The `quasi_univ` value has the following structure:
```ruby
quasi_univ =
  Universe [
    Atom "quasi_univ_level_1";
    Universe [Atom "quasi_univ_level_0"];
    Universe [
      Atom "quasi_univ_level_1";
      Universe [Atom "quasi_univ_level_0"];
      Universe [Atom "quasi_univ_level_1"; Universe [Atom "quasi_univ_level_0"]];
    ];
  ]
```
This structure represents a universe (`quasi_univ`) that contains three elements: the atom `Atom "quasi_univ_level_1"`, the universe `Universe [Atom "quasi_univ_level_0"]`, and another universe containing the first two elements as well as itself. This hierarchy represents a universe of universes, where each subsequent level contains all previous levels.

The code then prints out the string representation of the `quasi_univ` value, which should be:
```python
Universe ["quasi_univ_level_1","Universe [Atom "quasi_univ_level_0"]","Universe [Atom "quasi_univ_level_1",Universe [Atom "quasi_univ_level_0"],Universe [Atom "quasi_univ_level_1",Universe [Atom "quasi_univ_level_0"]]]"]
```
