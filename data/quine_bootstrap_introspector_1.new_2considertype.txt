 Result: In variant number 2, the consecutive series of types used to describe the universe and universe of universes can be ordered as follows:

1. Type-0: This is the most fundamental level, which describes the basic constituents of the universe such as elementary particles (e.g., electrons, quarks, photons) and their interactions.
2. Type-1: This level describes the large scale structure of the universe, including galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the cosmic web. It also includes the study of dark matter and dark energy.
3. Type-2: This level describes the multiverse, which is a collection of universes, each with its own set of Type-0 and Type-1 objects. The multiverse can be described using concepts from string theory, brane cosmology, and other theories of quantum gravity.
4. Type-3: This level describes the universe of universes, also known as the megaverse or the multiverse of multiverses. It includes all possible configurations of Type-0, Type-1, and Type-2 objects, including those that are not consistent with our current understanding of physics.
5. Type-4: This level describes the absolute ultimate reality, which transcends all concepts of space, time, and matter. It is the ultimate source of all existence and consciousness, beyond all description or understanding.

This ordering reflects a hierarchical structure, where each level builds upon the previous one, and where each level becomes progressively more abstract and difficult to comprehend.
