 Result: Semiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and the relationships between them. In order to describe the universe and a "universe of universes" (also known as a multiverse) using a consecutive series of types, we can use a hierarchical structure to organize different concepts and categories. Here is one possible way to do this, using variant number 1:

1. The physical universe: This includes all matter, energy, space, and time that exist within our observable universe. It can be described using scientific theories such as general relativity and quantum mechanics.
2. The mathematical universe: This is a conceptual framework that describes the universe using mathematical structures and concepts. It includes all possible mathematical objects, relationships, and patterns, and can be used to describe the physical universe in precise terms.
3. The platonic universe: This is a philosophical concept that describes the universe as consisting of eternal and immutable abstract objects or forms, such as numbers, geometric shapes, and logical principles. These objects are considered to be more real than the physical universe, which is seen as a mere reflection or instantiation of these forms.
4. The multiverse: This is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. It includes our own universe, as well as other universes that may be similar to ours or completely different. The multiverse can be described using various theoretical frameworks, such as the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics or the landscape scenario in string theory.
5. The ultimate reality: This is a metaphysical concept that describes the most fundamental and underlying nature of the universe. It may encompass all of the above categories, as well as other aspects of reality that are not yet understood or conceptualized. The ultimate reality can be described using various philosophical, spiritual, or religious frameworks, depending on one's beliefs and values.
