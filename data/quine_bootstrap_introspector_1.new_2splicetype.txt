 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a consecutive series of types that could be used to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse), using Variant 2:

1. Physical System: This type includes all physical objects and systems in the universe, such as galaxies, stars, planets, and molecules. It encompasses everything that is subject to the laws of physics.
2. Cosmic Structure: This type includes large-scale structures in the universe, such as galaxy clusters, superclusters, and voids. These structures are shaped by gravity and the distribution of matter in the universe.
3. Multiverse: This type includes all possible universes, each with its own set of physical systems and cosmic structures. It is a collection of all possible configurations of matter and energy.
4. Metaverse: This type includes all possible multiverses, each with its own set of universes. It represents the total set of all possible realities, including both actual and potential universes.
5. Conscious Observer: This type includes intelligent beings that are capable of perceiving and understanding the universe. It includes humans, as well as any other intelligent life forms that may exist in the multiverse or metaverse.
6. Mathematical Structure: This type includes abstract structures that describe the properties and behaviors of physical systems, cosmic structures, and conscious observers. It includes mathematical models, theories, and concepts that help us understand and predict the behavior of the universe.
7. Ultimate Reality: This type includes the underlying nature of reality itself, beyond the physical universe, multiverse, metaverse, and mathematical structures. It represents the deepest truths about the nature of existence, consciousness, and reality.

In this ordering, each type builds upon the previous one, creating a nested hierarchy that moves from the concrete to the abstract, and from the particular to the universal.
