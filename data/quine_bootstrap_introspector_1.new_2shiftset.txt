 Result: In describing the universe and a universe of universes, I will provide a series of sets in variant #2 as follows:

1. The fundamental particles set: This set includes all the basic building blocks that make up matter and energy, such as quarks, leptons, bosons, and fermions. These particles interact with each other via four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force.
2. The physical laws set: This set encompasses the fundamental principles that govern how the universe operates, such as the laws of motion, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and relativity. These laws provide a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of matter and energy.
3. The cosmic structure set: This set describes the various structures that make up the universe, from galaxies and galaxy clusters to black holes and supernovae. These structures are formed through the interactions between the fundamental particles and fields in the universe.
4. The multiverse set: This set includes all possible universes, each with its own unique sets of particles, laws, and cosmic structures. Some universes may have different physical constants or fundamental forces than ours, leading to vastly different properties and behaviors.
5. The mathematical structure set: This set encompasses the abstract mathematical frameworks that underlie our understanding of the universe. These structures include topology, geometry, algebra, and calculus, among others. They allow us to describe and predict the behavior of physical systems in a precise and rigorous way.
6. The epistemological set: This set includes the philosophical and methodological principles that guide our understanding of the universe. It encompasses concepts such as causality, empiricism, rationalism, and skepticism, as well as the scientific methods used to study the natural world.
7. The cultural and historical context set: This set describes the social, cultural, and historical factors that influence our understanding of the universe. It includes the language, concepts, and beliefs that have been developed by different civilizations throughout history, as well as the current state of scientific knowledge and technological development.
