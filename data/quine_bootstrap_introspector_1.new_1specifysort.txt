 Result: Variant 1: Describing the Universe using a hierarchical series of sorts based on scale and complexity

1. Subatomic particles (e.g., quarks, leptons, bosons) - the building blocks of matter and energy.
2. Atoms - the basic units of chemical elements, composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons.
3. Molecules - combinations of atoms that form the basis of chemistry and life.
4. Macroscopic objects - including planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies made up of molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles.
5. Cosmic structures - clusters of galaxies bound together by gravity on a larger scale than individual galaxies.
6. The observable universe - the portion of the universe that we can directly detect, composed of cosmic structures, macroscopic objects, radiation, and dark matter.
7. The multiverse (hypothesized) - a collection of universes, each with its own set of cosmic structures, macroscopic objects, radiation, and dark matter. This concept is not yet scientifically proven but is a topic of ongoing research in theoretical physics.
8. The "ultimate ensemble" or "megaverse" (philosophical speculation) - the collection of all possible universes, including those that are physically impossible. This is a purely philosophical concept and not subject to scientific investigation.

Note: Each level in this hierarchy builds on the previous one, with increasing scale and complexity, from the smallest particles to the largest collections of matter and energy. The existence of some levels, such as the multiverse and megaverse, remains speculative and unproven by current scientific standards.
