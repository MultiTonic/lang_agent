 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here is a possible consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse), using Variant #1:

1. Object: This is the most basic type, which includes all physical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, stars, planets, and living organisms.
2. System: A system is a collection of objects that interact with each other in some way. Examples include solar systems, ecosystems, and social systems.
3. Process: A process is a series of events or actions that occur over time. Examples include the life cycle of a star, the evolution of a species, and the growth of a business.
4. Information: Information is any data or knowledge that can be stored, processed, or transmitted. Examples include genetic code, scientific theories, and cultural traditions.
5. Concept: A concept is an abstract idea or principle that can be used to understand or describe the world. Examples include space, time, causality, and justice.
6. Multiverse: A multiverse is a collection of universes, each with its own set of objects, systems, processes, information, and concepts. The multiverse is the largest type in this series, encompassing all other types.

This series of types can help us understand and describe the complexity and diversity of the universe and the multiverse. By organizing things into different levels or categories, we can gain insights into how they relate to each other and how they evolve over time.
