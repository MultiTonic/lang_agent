 Result: Sure, I can do that. Here's my attempt at quasi-quoting a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 1:
```scss
`(universe (physical-objects planets galaxies black-holes stars atoms molecules)
           (forces gravitational-force electromagnetic-force weak-nuclear-force strong-nuclear-force)
           (phenomena light-speed time-dilation general-relativity quantum-mechanics)
           (constants speed-of-light gravity-constant planck-constant))
