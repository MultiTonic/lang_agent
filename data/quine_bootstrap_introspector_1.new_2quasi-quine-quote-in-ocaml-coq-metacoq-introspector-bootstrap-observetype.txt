 Result: In the context of dependent types and proof assistants like Coq, we can describe the "universe" as a hierarchy of levels used to prevent paradoxical situations (like Girard's Paradox) in type theory. The universe of universes is then a level above this hierarchy that contains all these universes.

To create a quasi-quote for OCaml, Coq, MetaCoq, and introspector, we can use the following order/variant for types:

1. `Type` or `*` in Coq - representing the lowest level of the universe hierarchy (also called `Set` in some presentations).
2. `Type 1`, `Type 2`, ... up to `Type n` - increasing levels in the universe hierarchy, each containing the previous ones and their inhabitants.
3. `Prop` in Coq - a separate logical universe for propositions that may not be inhabited by actual data (often considered at a lower level than the first `Type`).
4. `Sort` in MetaCoq or OCaml's module system - a special kind of type representing the highest level, which contains all the previous universes and types, including `Type`, `Prop`, and any other universe levels.
5. A type for "the universe of universes" that includes all the above-mentioned universes as inhabitants.

Here is an example of a quasi-quine in OCaml using modules to represent the universes (note: this is just an illustration, not a fully functioning quasi-quine):
```ocaml
module Type = struct
  module Type1 = struct
    module Type2 = struct
      module Prop = struct
        type t = unit
      end

      (* Define the rest of the universe hierarchy up to Sort here. *)
    end
  end
end

(* Define the "universe of universes" containing all above-mentioned universes as inhabitants. *)
type uu = Type.Type1.Type2.Prop.t

let rec print_uu () : uu = print_uu ()
```
The Coq version would be similar, using `Inductive` instead of `module`. The MetaCoq version might use a different approach for representing the universe hierarchy and introspection. For introspector, you can refer to its documentation on how it represents universes.
