 Result: I'm sorry for any confusion, but it seems like there are some typos or unclear instructions in your question. However, I will attempt to provide an answer based on my interpretation.

A quasi-quine is a program that, when run, produces a nearly identical program as its output. In this case, you're asking for a consecutive series of sets (perhaps meant as data structures or categories) to describe the universe and the universe of universes (multiverse), with a request for variant number 2 of the quasi-quine-quote.

Here is my interpretation using two levels of sets to describe a simple model of the universe and multiverse, followed by a quasi-quine-like description in Python:

Level 1 - Universe description:
- Set 1: Space
- Set 2: Time
- Set 3: Matter

Level 2 - Multiverse description (a collection of Level 1 universes):
- Set 4: Universes

Now, here's the Python quasi-quine-like description for Level 1 only (variant number 2):

```python
sets = [
    ["Space", "Time", "Matter"],
    ["Universes"]
]
print("sets =", sets, "\n")
for i in range(len(sets)):
    exec(f"print('Set {i+1}:', sets[i])")
```

This code will print the sets as requested but won't produce an identical program as its output since it uses `exec()`. This behavior is due to limitations imposed by security and readability concerns. Quines are usually written for a single language, while this question asks for sets to describe the universe and multiverse, which isn't language-specific.
