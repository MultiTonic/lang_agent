 Result: Sure! Here is one possible way to design a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a "universe of universes" using Variant Number 1:

1. Set of all physical particles in the universe
2. Set of all forces acting on those particles (e.g. gravity, electromagnetism, etc.)
3. Set of all fields permeating space that mediate those forces (e.g. gravitational field, electromagnetic field, etc.)
4. Set of all interactions between particles and fields
5. Set of all emergent phenomena arising from those interactions (e.g. atoms, molecules, stars, galaxies, etc.)
6. Set of all possible configurations of matter and energy in the universe, consistent with the laws of physics (i.e. the "phase space" of the universe)
7. Set of all possible "universes," each with its own set of particles, forces, fields, interactions, emergent phenomena, and configuration space
8. Set of all possible collections or ensembles of universes, i.e. a "universe of universes" or "multiverse."

Note that this is just one possible way to order the sets in this hierarchy. Depending on the specific context and goals of the analysis, other orderings might be more appropriate.
