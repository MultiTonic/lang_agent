 Result: Sure, I can provide a consecutive series of quotes to describe the universe and the concept of a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse). Here's one possible way to do it, using Variant Number 1:

1. "The universe is all that is or ever was or ever will be." - Carl Sagan
2. "The universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose." - J.B.S. Haldane
3. "The universe is a place so wondrous I cannot grasp it, so vast I cannot comprehend it. And yet, it is so small that each of us may contain a piece of it within ourselves." - Unknown
4. "In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded." - Terry Pratchett
5. "The universe is made up of a network of energy paths called quanta. A quantum can be thought of as a tiny, vibrating loop of energy." - Brian Greene
6. "Imagine a sphere so large that it contains all possible universes. This is the cosmic egg, the womb of creation, the source of all that exists and all that ever will exist." - Deepak Chopra
7. "The universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine." - Arthur Eddington
8. "In a multiverse, there are many universes, each one different from the others. Some may be similar to our own, while others may be completely alien and unrecognizable." - Max Tegmark
9. "The universe is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper." - Eden Phillpotts
10. "In the vast cosmic tapestry of existence, we are but a single thread. Yet, without us, the pattern would be incomplete." - Unknown
