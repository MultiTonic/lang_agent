 Result: Semiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and the relationships between them. In order to create a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes (a multiverse), we can use semiotics by creating sets that represent different levels of abstraction or conceptualization. Here's one possible ordering for variant number 1:

1. Set 1: Physical phenomena - This set includes all observable physical phenomena in the universe, such as galaxies, stars, planets, and subatomic particles. These phenomena can be described using mathematical models and scientific theories.
2. Set 2: Natural laws - This set includes the fundamental laws of physics that govern the behavior of physical phenomena. Examples include gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.
3. Set 3: Information - This set includes all the information that can be extracted from physical phenomena and natural laws. This could include data about the properties of subatomic particles, the distribution of galaxies in the universe, or the behavior of complex systems.
4. Set 4: Concepts - This set includes abstract concepts that cannot be directly observed but are derived from information. Examples include space, time, mass, and energy. These concepts form the basis for our understanding of the physical world.
5. Set 5: Theories - This set includes scientific theories that attempt to explain how the universe works at a fundamental level. Examples include general relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory.
6. Set 6: Multiverse - This set includes all possible universes, including our own universe. It represents the highest level of abstraction in this ordering.

This ordering is just one example of how semiotics can be used to describe the universe and a universe of universes. There are many other ways to approach this task, and different orderings may be better suited for different purposes or contexts.
