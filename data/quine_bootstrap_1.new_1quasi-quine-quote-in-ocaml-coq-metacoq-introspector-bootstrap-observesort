 Result: The task as given seems to be a combination of several different concepts, and it's not entirely clear what you are asking for. However, I will try to provide some information about each concept in order, according to the variant number 1 request.

Quasi-quine: A quasi-quine is a program that outputs a source code-like string that, when executed, produces the original program's source code. In OCaml, a simple quasi-quine could look like this:
```ocaml
let q = "let q = %S in print_endline q" ;;
print_endline q
```
When run, this program will output its own source code.

Coq and Metacoq: Coq is an interactive theorem prover for higher-order logic, while Metacoq is a metaprogramming framework for Coq that allows for introspection and manipulation of Coq's internal data structures. They are both tools used for formal verification of mathematical proofs and computer programs.

Introspector and bootstrap: Introspection refers to the ability of a program to examine its own structure, data, or properties at runtime. Bootstrapping, in the context of programming languages, refers to the process of using a language to implement a compiler for that same language.

Ordering: The concept of ordering is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. However, one possible interpretation is that you are asking for a series of steps or stages that could be used to describe the universe and the "universe of universes" (a concept from type theory) using the tools mentioned above. Here is a possible ordering:

1. Define a simple quasi-quine in OCaml, as shown above.
2. Use Coq to define formal proofs about mathematical concepts related to set theory and category theory.
3. Use Metacoq to introspect and manipulate Coq's internal data structures, allowing for more advanced metaprogramming techniques.
4. Define a "universe" in type theory as a collection of types, along with a hierarchy of universes that can contain other universes.
5. Use Metacoq to observe and manipulate the behavior of these universes, potentially leading to insights about the nature of the universe itself.
6. Bootstrap a new programming language or formal system using the tools and concepts developed above, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of the relationship between mathematics, computation, and reality.
