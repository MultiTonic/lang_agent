 Result: In this answer, I will provide a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a "universe of universes" (also known as a multiverse) using Variant Number 2. In this variant, we will define types that represent different levels of organization in the multiverse, from the smallest particles to the entire multiverse itself. The types will be organized in a hierarchical manner, with each type being a subset of the type above it.

Here is the consecutive series of types:

1. **Fundamental Particle**: This type represents the smallest indivisible units of matter and energy in the universe, such as quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons.
2. **Atom**: This type represents atoms, which are made up of fundamental particles bound together by nuclear forces.
3. **Molecule**: This type represents molecules, which are groups of atoms bonded together by chemical forces.
4. **Cell**: This type represents cells, which are the basic units of life and contain genetic material that determines their structure and function.
5. **Organism**: This type represents living organisms, which consist of one or more cells and can range from simple bacteria to complex multicellular organisms.
6. **Ecosystem**: This type represents ecosystems, which are communities of interacting organisms and their physical environment.
7. **Planet**: This type represents planets, which are large celestial bodies that orbit a star and have a solid surface.
8. **Star**: This type represents stars, which are massive, luminous spheres of plasma held together by gravity.
9. **Galaxy**: This type represents galaxies, which are vast systems of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity.
10. **Multiverse**: This type represents a "universe of universes," which is a collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of particles, forces, and fields.

The ordering of these types is such that each type is a subset of the type above it. For example, a molecule is made up of atoms, an atom is made up of fundamental particles, and so on. The multiverse is at the top of the hierarchy because it contains all other types of objects in the universe.

It's worth noting that this is just one possible way to organize types in a hierarchical manner to describe the universe and a "universe of universes." There are many other ways to do this, and different approaches may be more or less useful depending on the context and purpose of the classification scheme.
