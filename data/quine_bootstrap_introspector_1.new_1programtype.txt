 Result: In order to create a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes, I will use Variant Number 1. The types in this system will be organized as follows:

1. Type 0: Fundamental particles (e.g., quarks, leptons)
2. Type 1: Atoms (e.g., hydrogen, helium)
3. Type 2: Molecules (e.g., water, carbon dioxide)
4. Type 3: Macroscopic objects (e.g., planets, stars)
5. Type 4: Galaxy clusters (e.g., the Local Group)
6. Type 5: Universes (a collection of galaxy clusters)
7. Type 6: Multiverses (a collection of universes)

A universe of universes, in this context, would be a Type 7 entity. Each level in the hierarchy is built upon the previous one, forming a progressively larger and more complex structure. This system allows for a structured description of the universe and beyond, capturing the concept of a universe of universes as a coherent and organized whole.
