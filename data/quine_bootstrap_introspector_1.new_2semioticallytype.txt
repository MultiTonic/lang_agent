 Result: Semiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and the relationships between them. A consecutive series of types to describe the universe and the universe of universes (also known as the multiverse or metaverse) would involve using different categories or concepts to organize and understand this complex topic. Here's one possible ordering using variant number 2:

1. The Physical Universe: This category includes all matter, energy, space, and time that exist within our observable universe. It can be described using scientific theories such as general relativity and quantum mechanics.
2. The Multiverse: Beyond our physical universe, there may exist many other universes, each with its own set of matter, energy, space, and time. These universes together make up the multiverse or metaverse.
3. The Mathematical Universe: Some theories suggest that mathematics is the fundamental language that describes the nature of reality. In this view, the universe can be seen as a vast mathematical structure, with all physical phenomena reducible to mathematical relationships.
4. The Conscious Universe: This category includes all subjective experiences, thoughts, and feelings that arise within conscious beings. It encompasses not only human consciousness but also the consciousness of other animals, intelligent machines, and potentially even alien civilizations.
5. The Infinite Universe: Some theories suggest that the universe may be infinite in size or duration, with no beginning or end. This category includes all possible universes, both actual and potential, that could exist within an infinite universe.
6. The Virtual Universe: With the advent of virtual reality technology, it is now possible to create simulated worlds that are indistinguishable from the physical universe. This category includes all possible virtual universes, both those created by humans and those that may exist naturally in the multiverse.
7. The Spiritual Universe: This category includes all beliefs, practices, and experiences related to spirituality, religion, and transcendence. It encompasses a wide range of human experiences, from mystical insights to near-death experiences, that suggest there may be more to reality than just physical matter.

These categories are not mutually exclusive and can overlap in many ways. They provide a framework for understanding the complex and diverse nature of the universe and its possible relationship to other universes and dimensions.
