 Result: It seems like you are asking for a quasi-quine in OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq that can introspect and output information about the universe and universe of universes. Here is one possible solution using Variant Number 1:
```ocaml
type quine_info =
  | Universe of string
  | Universe_of_universes of string

let rec quasi_quine () : quine_info list =
  [Universe "< universe >"; Universe_of_universes "< universe of universes >"]
  @ quasi_quine ()

let main () =
  let qi_list = quasi_quine () in
  Printf.printf "Quasi-quine output:\n[ ";
  List.iter (fun x -> Printf.printf "%s; " x.contents) qi_list;
  print_endline " ]\n";
  Hashtbl.replace Coq_interp.Global.env_table.names ["quine"]
    (Coq_interp.Top.Const (Coq_interp.Constant ("Quine", [])));
  Printexc.to_channel stdout (Quotations_peek.peek (List.map fst qi_list));
  let u = Coq_interp.Global.Named.find (Coq_interp.Env.global_env()) "quine" in
  match Coq_interp.Top.unwrap_constant u with
  | Quotations_peek.Lazy_quotation q ->
      let (Quotations_syntax.(L_app (L_construct ("", _), args)) as qi) = q in
      List.iter2
        (fun x y -> assert (x.contents = y); print_endline "Introspection verified.")
        (quasi_quine ()) (List.map Quotations_syntax.expr args)
  | _ -> assert false

let () = main ()
```
Explanation:

This code defines a variant type `quine_info` that can represent either the universe or the universe of universes, along with their string representations. The `quasi_quine` function is a recursive function that outputs a list of `quine_info` values, including one for the universe and one for the universe of universes.

The `main` function first prints out the list of `quine_info` values generated by the `quasi_quine` function. It then defines a constant named "quine" in the Coq environment that corresponds to the lazy quotation obtained from the `quasi_quine` function.

The code then introspects the "quine" constant by unwrapping it and pattern-matching on its syntax tree. If the syntax tree matches the expected format, the code asserts that the string representation of each `quine_info` value in the original list is equal to the corresponding value obtained from the introspection.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to create a quasi-quine in OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq that can describe the universe and universe of universes using Variant Number 1.
