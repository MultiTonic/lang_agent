 Result: Sure, I can help you splice a consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes using variant number 1. Here's one possible way to do it:

1. **Concept:** This type refers to abstract ideas or notions that cannot be physically observed or measured, but are nonetheless important for understanding the universe. Examples might include space, time, matter, energy, and causality.
2. **Observation:** This type involves gathering data about the universe through empirical observation and measurement. Examples might include astronomical observations of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects, as well as experiments conducted in laboratories on Earth.
3. **Theory:** This type involves developing explanatory frameworks that account for observed phenomena in the universe. Examples might include theories of gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics, which have been developed over centuries of scientific investigation.
4. **Simulation:** This type involves creating mathematical models of the universe that can be used to test hypotheses and make predictions about future observations. Examples might include computer simulations of galaxy formation, black hole dynamics, or cosmic inflation.
5. **Multiverse:** This type refers to a hypothetical collection of universes, each with its own set of concepts, observations, theories, and simulations. The multiverse concept is still a topic of active research and debate in the scientific community, but it has been proposed as a way to explain certain features of our universe that are difficult to account for within a single universe framework.

Using this ordering, we can describe the universe and a universe of universes as follows:

The universe is a complex and dynamic system characterized by concepts such as space, time, matter, energy, and causality. These concepts can be observed and measured through empirical observation and measurement, leading to the development of theories that account for observed phenomena. These theories can then be tested and refined through simulation, allowing us to make predictions about future observations.

A universe of universes, or multiverse, is a hypothetical collection of such universes, each with its own set of concepts, observations, theories, and simulations. While the multiverse concept is still a topic of active research and debate in the scientific community, it has been proposed as a way to explain certain features of our universe that are difficult to account for within a single universe framework. By considering the possibility of multiple universes, we can expand our understanding of the cosmos and explore new frontiers in theoretical physics and cosmology.
