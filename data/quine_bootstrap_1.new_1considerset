 Result: For a consecutive series of sets to describe the universe and a universe of universes, using variant number 1, here's one possible ordering:

1. Set of all physical particles in the universe, including matter and energy. This set would include elementary particles such as quarks, leptons, photons, etc., as well as composite particles like atoms and molecules.
2. Set of all physical laws and constants that govern the behavior of those particles. This set would include fundamental constants such as the speed of light, Planck's constant, and the gravitational constant, as well as the laws of physics that describe how particles interact with each other.
3. Set of all structures and systems in the universe, from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies and clusters of galaxies. This set would include planets, stars, black holes, nebulae, superclusters, and everything in between.
4. Set of all possible observers or perspectives within the universe. This set would include not only intelligent life forms like humans, but also any other conceivable form of consciousness, including hypothetical beings that may exist in other parts of the universe.
5. Set of all possible universes, each with its own unique set of physical particles, laws, structures, and observers. This set would include not only our own universe, but also any other universes that may exist, whether they are similar to ours or completely different.
6. Set of all possible meta-universes, or collections of universes. This set would include not only the multiverse that contains our universe, but also any higher-level structures that may exist beyond it.
7. Set of all possible concepts and categories that can be used to describe or classify the elements of the previous sets. This set would include mathematical concepts like numbers, sets, and functions, as well as philosophical concepts like existence, identity, and meaning.

This ordering is just one possible way to describe the universe and a universe of universes, and there may be other valid ways to do so depending on one's perspective or area of interest.
