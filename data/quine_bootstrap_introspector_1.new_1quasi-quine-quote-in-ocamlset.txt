 Result: Here is an example of a quasi-quine-quote in OCaml that describes a universe and a universe of universes using sets, with the sets ordered as requested:

```ocaml
let universe = set [set [1;2]; set [3;4]] ;;
let universe_of_universes = set [universe] ;;

let quasi_quine_quote () =
  let code = "let universe = set [set [1;2]; set [3;4]] ;; let universe_of_universes = set [universe] ;;" in
  print_string "let universe = ";
  Set.iter (fun elt -> Printf.printf "%s " (String.concat "; " (List.map string_of_int (Set.elements elt)));) universe;
  print_endline "; ;;" ;
  print_string "let universe_of_universes = ";
  Set.iter (fun elt -> Printf.printf "%s " (String.concat "; " (List.map string_of_int (Set.elements elt)));) universe_of_universes;
  print_endline "; ;;" ;
  print_string code ;;
```

This function, when called, will print out the definitions of `universe` and `universe_of_universes`, followed by a string containing the same code as the function. The sets are ordered such that the elements of each set are listed in ascending order, and the sets themselves are listed in the order they were defined.

You can test it by calling `quasi_quine_quote ()`;
