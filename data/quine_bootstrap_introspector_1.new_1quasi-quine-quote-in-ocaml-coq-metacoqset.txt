 Result: In the context of the question, I will assume that by "set" you are referring to types or type theories in the field of formal mathematics. Here is an attempt at a consecutive series of types (or universes) from smallest to largest, using OCaml, Coq, and MetaCoq:

1. The type `int` in OCaml, which represents the set of integer values.
2. The type `unit` in OCaml, which represents the singleton set containing only the value `()`.
3. The built-in universe `Prop` in Coq, which represents the propositional universe of types that can be decided by a computation.
4. The built-in universe `Set` in Coq, which represents the type universe of sets and other inductive types.
5. The universe hierarchy in Coq, starting with `Set1`, `Set2`, `Set3`, etc., where each universe contains the previous one.
6. The "superuniverse" or "uxtype" in MetaCoq, which is a type representing all of the universes in Coq, including itself. This is implemented as an extension to Coq's type theory.

Note that this series is just one possible way of ordering the universes and may not be exhaustive or universally agreed upon.
