 Result: In variant number 2, we will describe the universe and the "universe of universes" using a consecutive series of sets, where each set represents a level of organization or hierarchy in the multiverse. Here is one possible ordering:

1. The Universe: This set contains all physical matter, energy, space, and time that exist within our observable universe. It includes galaxies, stars, planets, black holes, and all other objects and phenomena that we can detect with our scientific instruments.
2. Multiverse: This set contains all universes, including ours, that exist in a broader cosmological context. The multiverse may contain many universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. Some theories suggest that the multiverse is infinite in size and contains an infinite number of universes.
3. Set of all mathematical structures: This set contains all possible mathematical structures, including numbers, shapes, groups, rings, fields, and other abstract objects. These structures may or may not have physical instantiation, but they provide a useful framework for understanding the properties and behaviors of physical systems.
4. Set of all possible computational processes: This set contains all possible algorithms, programs, and computational procedures that can be executed by a Turing machine or other abstract computing device. These processes may describe physical phenomena, mathematical structures, or other abstract objects.
5. Set of all possible conceptual frameworks: This set contains all possible ways of organizing and interpreting information, including scientific theories, philosophical systems, religious beliefs, and artistic expressions. These frameworks provide a way of making sense of the world around us and guiding our actions within it.
6. Universe of universes: This set contains all sets, including the ones described above, that exist in any possible context or perspective. It represents the ultimate limit of conceptual organization, beyond which there is nothing left to describe or understand.

This ordering is just one possible way of describing the universe and the universe of universes using a consecutive series of sets. There may be other orderings that are equally valid or more illuminating, depending on the specific context and goals of the inquiry.
