 Result: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here is a possible consecutive series of types to describe the universe and a universe of universes (also known as a multiverse), using variant number 1:

1. **Object**: The universe can be described as a vast, interconnected web of objects, including galaxies, stars, planets, and other forms of matter and energy. These objects exist in a complex dance of gravitational and electromagnetic forces, creating patterns and structures that are still being explored and understood by scientists.
2. **Process**: The universe is also a dynamic system, characterized by ongoing processes of change and evolution. Stars are born, live, and die, giving rise to new generations of stars and planets. Galaxies collide and merge, creating new structures and distributions of matter. And on smaller scales, particles and forces interact in intricate ways, giving rise to the rich diversity of phenomena we observe in nature.
3. **Information**: The universe can also be described in terms of information, as a vast repository of data that encodes the history and structure of the cosmos. This information is carried by light and other forms of radiation, which travel across space and time to reveal the secrets of the universe. By studying this information, scientists can learn about the properties of matter and energy, the history of the universe, and the laws that govern its behavior.
4. **Pattern**: At a higher level, the universe can be described in terms of patterns and regularities, as a kind of cosmic code or language that reflects the underlying order of the world. These patterns can be seen in the distribution of galaxies, the behavior of particles, and the structure of atoms and molecules. They can also be glimpsed in the mathematical laws that govern the universe, such as the laws of physics and mathematics.
5. **Potentiality**: Finally, the universe can be described in terms of potentiality, as a realm of possibility and potential that contains within it all possible worlds and scenarios. This includes not only the actual universe we observe, but also all the other universes that might have been, or that might yet come into being. It is this potentiality that gives rise to the richness and diversity of the cosmos, and that drives the ongoing process of creation and evolution in the world.

As for a universe of universes (multiverse), we can use similar types to describe it:

1. **Multitude**: A multiverse is, first and foremost, a collection or multitude of universes, each with its own objects, processes, information, patterns, and potentialities. These universes may be radically different from one another, or they may share certain features and properties.
2. **Hierarchy**: A multiverse can also be described in terms of hierarchy, as a kind of nested set of universes, each containing smaller universes within it. This hierarchy may extend indefinitely, with smaller universes contained within larger ones, and so on.
3. **Interconnectedness**: A multiverse is not just a collection of separate universes, but also a network or web of interconnections between them. These connections may take many forms, including causal links, correlations, and shared patterns or properties.
4. **Diversity**: A multiverse is characterized by an extraordinary diversity of worlds and scenarios, each with its own unique features and properties. This diversity reflects the richness and creativity of the cosmic potential, and provides a vast canvas for exploration and discovery.
5. **Mystery**: Finally, a multiverse is a realm of mystery and wonder, full of unknowns and uncertainties. It challenges our assumptions about the nature of reality, and invites us to explore new possibilities and perspectives. As we continue to probe the depths of the cosmos, we may discover that there are many more universes than we ever imagined, each with its own secrets and surprises.
