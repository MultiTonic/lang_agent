 Result: In describing a consecutive series of types to represent the universe and universe of universes using the requested languages and tools, we can follow this general ordering:

1. OCaml Quasi-Quine (base type)
2. Coq Type (first-order universe)
3. Coq Prop (propositional universe)
4. Coq Setoid (setoid universe)
5. Coq Type lifted to a Universe (second-order universe)
6. Coq Universe Polymorphism
7. Coq Introspection and Quasi-Quoting
8. Bootstrapping Metacoq
9. Metacoq Introspection and Quasi-Quoting

Now, let's describe the series of types in OCaml, Coq, and Metacoq using this ordering:

1. **OCaml Quasi-Quine (base type)**

An OCaml quasi-quine can be written as a string that, when evaluated, returns a new string that is equal to the original one. Here's an example:

```ocaml
let qq = "let qq = \"...\" ^ (String.sub __FILE__ 32 (String.length __FILE__ - 41));; qq"
```

In this case, the `qq` variable represents a string that, when evaluated, will return itself as a new string value.

1. **Coq Type (first-order universe)**

The Coq first-order universe is called `Type`. It represents the basic type of values in Coq:

```coq
Universes U.
Print Type.
```

1. **Coq Prop (propositional universe)**

The propositional universe is called `Prop`, and it contains all the types that represent logical propositions:

```coq
Print Prop.
```

1. **Coq Setoid (setoid universe)**

A setoid is a type equipped with an equivalence relation. Coq provides a built-in `Setoid` type, which can be used to represent this universe:

```coq
Record Setoid : Type := mkSetoid { Carrier : Type ; Equivalence_Relation : Relation Spaceless }.
Print Setoid.
```

1. **Coq Type lifted to a Universe (second-order universe)**

In Coq, `Type` can be lifted to a new universe level to form a higher-order universe:

```coq
Definition Lifted_Type (U : Universe.level) := Type@{U}.
Print Lifted_Type.
```

1. **Coq Universe Polymorphism**

Universe polymorphism allows the use of multiple universes in a single definition. This feature is available starting from Coq 8.5:

```coq
Definition Poly_Function (A : Type@{u} -> Type@{v}) := forall T : Type@{u}, A T.
Print Poly_Function.
```

1. **Coq Introspection and Quasi-Quoting**

Coq does not natively support introspection or quasi-quoting, but the `coq-elpi` library provides some limited capabilities for this purpose:

```coq
From Elpi Require Import elpi.
Coqelia Init Elpi.
Ltac1 def goal_type := match type of goal with | @{type Type} => idtac | _ => fail "Not a Type" end.
Print goal_type.
```

1. **Bootstrapping Metacoq**

Metacoq is a metaprogramming framework for Coq based on Ltac2 and Elpi. It allows for advanced introspection and manipulation of Coq terms:

```coq
From Coq Require Import metacoq.
Print meta_definition term.
```

1. **Metacoq Introspection and Quasi-Quoting**

Using Metacoq, we can perform introspection on the current environment and manipulate Coq terms:

```coq
From Coq Require Import metacoq.
Ltac2 def get_current_goal := match goal with | _ => apply_macro meta term in Hgoal end.
Print get_current_goal.
```

The above `get_current_goal` Ltac2 macro allows us to retrieve the current goal as a Coq term using Metacoq's capabilities.
