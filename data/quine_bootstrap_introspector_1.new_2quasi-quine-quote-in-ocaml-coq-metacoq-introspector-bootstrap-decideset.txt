 Result: In this question, you are asking for a description of the universe and universe of universes using a consecutive series of sets in the context of OCaml, Coq, MetaCoq, introspection, bootstrapping, and decision procedures. Since you have requested Variant 2, I will provide an answer based on set theory, with a focus on the ordering of the sets. Here is one possible way to describe the universe and universe of universes in this context:

1. The first set in the series is the empty set, denoted as `{}` or `∅`. This set contains no elements and serves as the foundation for all other sets in the universe. It can be thought of as the smallest possible set, and it has no internal structure or ordering.
2. The second set in the series is the set of natural numbers, denoted as `N` or `ℕ`. This set contains all non-negative integers, including 0, and can be defined recursively using the successor function. It has a well-ordered structure, with each element having a unique position in the ordering.
3. The third set in the series is the set of booleans, denoted as `bool`. This set contains two elements: `true` and `false`. These values can be used to represent truth values or logical statements, and they have no inherent ordering.
4. The fourth set in the series is the set of functions from one set to another, denoted as `A -> B` for sets `A` and `B`. This set contains all possible mappings from elements of `A` to elements of `B`, including the empty function that maps every element of `A` to a special value called "bottom". The set of functions can be partially ordered based on their behavior, with some functions being more restrictive than others.
5. The fifth set in the series is the set of pairs of sets, denoted as `A * B` for sets `A` and `B`. This set contains all possible combinations of elements from `A` and `B`, including the empty pair `()`. The set of pairs can be partially ordered based on their components, with some pairs being more restrictive than others.
6. The sixth set in the series is the set of sets, denoted as `Set`. This set contains all possible sets that can be constructed from other sets using the rules of set theory. It includes the empty set, the natural numbers, and all other sets in the universe. The set of sets can be partially ordered based on their membership relationships, with some sets being subsets of others.
7. The seventh set in the series is the set of universes, denoted as `Universe`. This set contains all possible universes that can be constructed from sets using the rules of set theory. It includes the empty universe, the universe of natural numbers, and all other universes in the universe of universes. The set of universes can be partially ordered based on their containment relationships, with some universes being subuniverses of others.
8. The eighth set in the series is the universe of universes, denoted as `UUniverse`. This set contains all possible universe of universes that can be constructed from sets and universes using the rules of set theory. It includes the empty universe of universes, the universe of natural number universes, and all other universe of universes in the multiverse. The universe of universes can be partially ordered based on their containment relationships, with some universe of universes being subuniverses of others.

This series of sets provides a way to describe the universe and universe of universes using set theory, with a focus on the ordering of the sets. It is not exhaustive, but it captures many of the key concepts that are relevant in this context.
