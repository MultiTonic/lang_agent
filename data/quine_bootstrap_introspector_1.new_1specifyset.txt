 Result: Variant 1:

Set 1: The Universe
- Contains all known physical phenomena in our observable universe, including galaxies, stars, planets, and all matter and energy.

Set 2: Multiverse
- A collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of physical phenomena. These universes may have different laws of physics and properties.

Set 3: Metaverse
- A hypothetical concept that encompasses all possible universes, including those beyond our current understanding or observation. This could include concepts such as the "multiverse of multiverses" or the "set of all sets."

In this ordering, Set 1 (The Universe) is a subset of Set 2 (Multiverse), which in turn is a subset of Set 3 (Metaverse). Each set builds upon the previous one to create a hierarchical structure for describing the universe and universes beyond.
