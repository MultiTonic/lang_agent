 Result: I'm assuming that by "variant number 1" you mean a request for me to describe the universe and a universe of universes in ascending order of complexity and inclusivity. Here is one possible consecutive series of sorts to do so:

1. The physical universe: This includes all matter, energy, space, and time that exist within our observable universe. It encompasses everything from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies, as well as all the forces and interactions between them.
2. The multiverse: This is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of physical laws and properties. Some models suggest that these universes may be causally disconnected from one another, meaning that they cannot interact or influence each other in any way.
3. The landscape of string theory: In string theory, the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not point-like particles but tiny, vibrating strings. The theory predicts a vast "landscape" of possible vacuum solutions, each corresponding to a different set of physical laws and interactions. Some models suggest that our universe may be just one of many such vacua in this landscape.
4. The Platonic realm: In Platonism, the ultimate reality is not the physical world but a realm of abstract, eternal, and unchanging forms or ideas. These forms are the true objects of knowledge, and the physical world is merely a shadow or reflection of them.
5. The mind of God: In many religious and philosophical traditions, the ultimate reality is conceived as a divine mind or consciousness that transcends the physical universe. This mind is thought to be the source of all being, knowledge, and value, and to encompass everything that exists within and beyond the universe.
6. The universe of universes: This is a hypothetical concept that goes beyond even the idea of a multiverse or a landscape of string theory. It suggests that there may be an infinite hierarchy of universes, each containing its own set of physical laws and properties, and each nested within a larger universe that contains it. This ultimate universe of universes would be the source of all existence and the limit of all knowledge.
