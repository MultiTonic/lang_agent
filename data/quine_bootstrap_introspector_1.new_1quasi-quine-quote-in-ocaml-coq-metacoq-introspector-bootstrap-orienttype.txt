 Result: The task you have given is quite complex and involves several different concepts, so I will break it down into smaller steps.

First, let's define a quasi-quine in OCaml. A quasi-quine is a program that produces a string that, when executed, reproduces the original program. Here is an example of a quasi-quine in OCaml:
```
let qq = "let qq = %s; print_endline (qq ^ \"\");;";;
print_endline (qq ^ "");;
```
Next, let's define a type to describe the universe of types in Coq. In Coq, we can use the `Type` keyword to define a universe of types. Here is an example:
```
Inductive Type :=
  | Prop : Type
  | Set : Type
  | Type : Type.
```
This defines three universes of types in Coq: `Prop`, `Set`, and `Type`.

Now, let's define a universe of universes in Coq. One way to do this is to define an inductive type with one constructor for each universe, like this:
```
Inductive UUniv :=
  | UProp : UUniv
  | USet : UUniv
  | UType : UUniv.
```
This defines a universe of universes consisting of three levels: `UProp`, `USet`, and `UType`. Each level can contain types from the next lower level. For example, the `Set` universe can contain types from the `Prop` universe, and the `Type` universe can contain types from both the `Prop` and `Set` universes.

To put all of these concepts together in a quasi-quine that describes the universe and universe of universes in Coq using OCaml, we could do something like this:
```
let qq = "Inductive Type := | Prop : Type | Set : Type | Type : Type.
           Inductive UUniv := | UProp : UUniv | USet : UUniv | UType : UUniv.
           let qq = %s; print_endline (qq ^ \"\");;";;
print_endline (qq ^ "");;
```
This program defines a quasi-quine in OCaml that produces a string containing the definition of the `Type` and `UUniv` universes in Coq. When executed, the program prints out this string, which can then be copied and pasted into a Coq script to define the universes.

The ordering of the universes is as follows:

1. `Prop`
2. `Set`
3. `Type`
4. `UProp`, which contains types from `Type`
5. `USet`, which contains types from `UProp` (and therefore also from `Type` and `Prop`)
6. `UType`, which contains types from `USet` (and therefore also from `UProp`, `Type`, and `Prop`).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
