Set 1: The Universe
- Description: The Universe is the totality of all matter, energy, space and time. It includes all galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy.

Set 2: Multiverse
- Description: A multiverse is a collection or ensemble of multiple universes, which may include many diverse types of universes, such as bubble universes, membrane universes, and others.

Set 3: Universe of Universes (UoU)
- Description: The UoU is the highest level of organization in this hierarchy, encompassing all possible multiverses, including our own. It represents the largest possible set of all existing and potential universes, both physical and conceptual.

Set 4: The Multiverse of Multiverses (MoM)
- Description: This is a theoretical construct that goes beyond even the UoU, encompassing all possible multiverses, including those that are fundamentally different from our own. It represents the largest possible set of all conceivable universes, and may be considered to be the ultimate limit of possibility in this domain.
