 Result: The task quasi-quine-quote-in-ocaml-coq-metacoq-introspector asks for a self-replicating piece of code in OCaml, Coq, or MetaCoq that also includes introspection about the universe and universe of universes.

In this problem, by "universe" we mean a collection of types/propositions closed under dependent sums, products, and function spaces (i.e., a Grothendieck universe). By "universe of universes" we mean a collection of such universes closed under the same operations.

To answer your question, I will describe an approach to this task using variant number 1, which is to write a quasi-quine in OCaml that also includes introspection about the universe and universe of universes. The ordering I propose for the series of sets is as follows:

1. Types/propositions within each universe
2. Universes within the universe of universes
3. The hierarchy of universes (if we choose to include it)

Here is an outline of how this might look in OCaml:
```ocaml
type 'a u = ... (* Define a universe type, which could be similar to Coq's Type or Prop *)

let my_universe : (unit -> unit u) u =
  let module M = struct
    type 'a t = 'a u
    ...
  end in
  (module M : sig
     type 'a t = 'a u
     ...
   end)

(* Define a function to construct the universe of universes *)
let my_universe_of_universes : (unit -> _ u) u =
  let module Mu = struct
    type 'a t = ('a, unit -> unit u) Coq.Set.Make(struct
      type t = 'a u
      ...
    end).t in
    ...
  end in
  (module Mu : sig
     type 'a t = ('a, unit -> unit u) Coq.Set.Make(...).t
     ...
   end)

(* Define a function to construct the hierarchy of universes *)
let rec my_universe_hierarchy : (unit -> _ u) u list =
  [my_universe] ::
  let module Muu = struct
    type 'a t = ('a, (unit -> _ u) list) Coq.Set.Make(struct
      type t = 'a u
      ...
    end).t in
    ...
  end in
  (module Muu : sig
     type 'a t = ('a, (unit -> _ u) list) Coq.Set.Make(...).t
     ...
   end) :: my_universe_hierarchy

(* Define a quasi-quine that includes the above definitions *)
let code = "type 'a u = ...\nlet my_universe = ...\nlet my_universe_of_universes = ...\nlet my_universe_hierarchy = ...\nlet code = \"...\";;...";;;
```
Note that the above code is just a rough sketch, and would need to be filled in with more details depending on how we choose to define the universe type `'a u`. The idea is to define the universe type as a functor from some parameter type `'a`, so that we can later instantiate it with different parameters to create multiple universes. We then define a function to construct the universe of universes by using OCaml's built-in `Set` module, which provides sets of elements with an equality comparison and an ordering (though we don't need to use the ordering in this problem). Finally, we define a recursive function to construct the hierarchy of universes, where each element of the list is a universe constructed at a different level of the hierarchy.

The quasi-quine itself is simply a string that includes all of the above definitions (except for the definition of `code` itself, which is defined separately). When executed, this string should be parsed and evaluated as OCaml code, reproducing the original definitions and therefore behaving like a self-replicating quasi-quine.
