 Result: Here is a possible ordering for describing the universe and the "universe of universes" (also known as the multiverse) using variant number 1:

1. The observable universe: This is the part of the universe that we can directly observe and study, because it is within the range of our telescopes. It includes all the galaxies, stars, planets, and other matter and energy that are visible to us.
2. The entire universe: While we can only observe a portion of the universe, scientists believe that there is much more beyond what we can see. They estimate that the entire universe is made up of around 100 billion galaxies, each containing billions of stars and planets.
3. The multiverse: This is a hypothetical concept that describes a collection of many universes, each with its own set of matter, energy, and laws of physics. It is not known for certain whether the multiverse exists, but some theories suggest that it may be possible.
4. Higher-dimensional spaces: Some theories propose that our universe may be just one of many branes (short for "membranes") floating in a higher-dimensional space. These branes could be stacked on top of each other or intersecting in complex ways, creating a vast landscape of possible universes.
5. The ultimate ensemble: This is the most inclusive concept of all, encompassing all possible universes that can exist, including those that are inconsistent with our current understanding of physics. It is a theoretical framework that allows for the exploration of all conceivable realities and possibilities.
