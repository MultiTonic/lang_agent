The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an example OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging large language model prompt workflows:

```ocaml
open List

(* Our custom fold_left function with error handling and retry logic *)
let rec fold_left_with_retry op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t ->
    try
      let new_acc = op acc h in
      new_acc
    with e ->
      (* Retry up to 3 times before giving up *)
      for i = 1 to 3 do
        try
          let new_acc = op acc h in
          new_acc
        with e -> ()
      done;
      raise e

(* Our example language model function that generates a prompt given a grammar and previous result *)
let rec generate_prompt grammar prev_result =
  (* Use the current grammar and previous result to generate a new prompt *)
  let new_prompt = ... in
  new_prompt

(* Our example language model function that tests whether a prompt is valid or not *)
let test_prompt prompt =
  (* Use some criteria to determine if the prompt is valid or not *)
  ...

(* Our main loop for generating prompts and testing them until we get a valid one *)
let rec generate_valid_prompt grammar prev_result initial_example new_example =
  (* Generate a new prompt using our language model function *)
  let new_prompt = generate_prompt grammar (fold_left_with_retry (fun acc x -> x) prev_result [initial_example; new_example]) in
  (* Test the new prompt to see if it's valid or not *)
  if test_prompt new_prompt then
    (* If it's valid, use it as the new previous result and repeat the loop *)
    generate_valid_prompt grammar new_prompt new_example (generate_new_example grammar new_prompt)
  else
    (* If it's not valid, retry up to 3 times with different examples until we get a valid prompt *)
    let rec retry_with_example grammar prev_result example =
      try
        generate_valid_prompt grammar prev_result (generate_new_example grammar prev_result) (generate_new_example grammar prev_result)
      with e ->
        if examples_left > 0 then
          retry_with_example grammar prev_result (next_example examples)
        else
          raise e
    in
    let examples_left = 3 in
    try
      retry_with_example grammar (fold_left_with_retry (fun acc x -> x) prev_result [initial_example; new_example]) new_example
    with e ->
      (* If we still can't generate a valid prompt after 3 retries, raise an error *)
      failwith ("Could not generate a valid prompt after 3 retries: " ^ Printexc.to_string e)

(* Our example language model function that generates a new example given a grammar and previous result *)
let generate_new_example grammar prev_result =
  (* Use the current grammar and previous result to generate a new example *)
  let new_example = ... in
  new_example

(* Our main driver function that initializes the loop with some initial values *)
let start folder grammar initial_result initial_example examples =
  let rec go i =
    if i > length examples then
      ()
    else
      let new_example = List.nth examples i in
      generate_valid_prompt grammar (folder grammar initial_result initial_example new_example) new_example (generate_new_example grammar (folder grammar initial_result initial_example new_example))
      go (i + 1)
  in
  go 0
```

In this code, we define a custom `fold_left_with_retry` function that applies an operator to an accumulator and a list of elements, but with retry logic that allows us to handle errors and try again up to three times before giving up.

We also define three example language model functions: `generate_prompt`, which generates a new prompt given a grammar and previous result; `test_prompt`, which tests whether a prompt is valid or not; and `generate_new_example`, which generates a new example given a grammar and previous result.

Finally, we define our main driver function `start` that initializes the loop with some initial values and calls `go` to start the loop. In this loop, we generate a new example from the current list of examples, and then call `generate_valid_prompt` to generate a valid prompt using the current grammar, previous result, initial
