The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an OCaml code that implements a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a large language model, based on your description:
```ocaml
type input = Grammar of string | Previous of string | NewExample of string

let rec merge_inputs inputs acc =
  match inputs with
  | [] -> acc
  | h::t -> (
    match h with
    | Grammar a -> merge_inputs t (a :: acc)
    | Previous d -> merge_inputs t (d :: acc)
    | NewExample c ->
      let merged = String.concat " " (List.rev acc) in
      let new_output = run_language_model merged in (* replace this with actual function *)
      if is_good_output new_output then
        merge_inputs t [new_output]
      else if List.length acc < 3 then
        merge_inputs (t @ [NewExample c]) acc
      else
        merged (* return the last merged prompt if all attempts fail *)
    )

let start_merge inputs =
  let _ = Printf.printf "Starting merge with inputs : %s\n" (String.concat ", " (List.map (function | Grammar a -> a | Previous d | NewExample c -> c) inputs)) in
  merge_inputs inputs []
```
The code defines a new data type `input` to represent the different types of inputs, and implements a recursive function `merge_inputs` that takes a list of inputs and an accumulator. The function matches on each input in the list and updates the accumulator accordingly. If all attempts fail, it returns the last merged prompt.

The code also includes a helper function `start_merge` to print out the inputs before merging them. You can replace the `run_language_model` function with an actual implementation that runs your large language model and returns the generated output. The `is_good_output` function is also a placeholder that checks whether the generated output is good or not, based on your criteria.

Note: This code is just one possible way to implement the prompt merging system, and may need to be adjusted based on the specifics of your large language model and game environment.
