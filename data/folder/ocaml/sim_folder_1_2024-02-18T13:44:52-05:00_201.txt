The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here's an OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging streams of the matrix:
```ocaml
type error = string
type result = Success of string | Error of error

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t ->
    let (new_acc, result) = merge_with_grammar h acc in
    match result with
    | Success _ -> fold_left op new_acc t
    | Error err ->
      if t <> [] then
        let (new_acc, _) = merge_with_grammar h.grammar new_acc in
        (new_acc, Error ("Recoverable error: " ^ err))
      else
        (new_acc, Error err)

and merge_with_grammar grammar acc input =
  let open Result in
  let result = large_language_model grammar acc input in
  match result with
  | Ok output -> Success (output, output)
  | Error err ->
    if acc <> "" then
      let output = merge_with_previous_result acc input in
      Success (output, sprintf "Recovered error: %s" err)
    else
      Error ("Unrecoverable error: " ^ err)

and large_language_model grammar acc input =
  (* Implement the large language model using the provided inputs and grammar *)
  ...

and merge_with_previous_result prev_results input =
  (* Merge the previous results with the new input to create a new output *)
  ...
```
The `fold_left` function takes an operator `op`, an accumulator `acc`, and a list of inputs, and applies the operator to each element of the list in order, passing the result as the accumulator for the next application. In this case, the operator `merge_with_grammar` is used to merge each input with the current accumulator using the provided grammar.

The `merge_with_grammar` function takes a grammar and an accumulator as inputs, along with an input to be merged. It uses the `large_language_model` function to generate a new output from the input and grammar. If this generates an error, it tries to merge the previous results with the new input to create a new output.

The `large_language_model` function implements the actual large language model using the provided inputs and grammar. This implementation is left for the user to provide.

The `merge_with_previous_result` function merges the previous results with the new input to create a new output. This implementation is also left for the user to provide, as it will depend on the specific format of the previous results and the desired format of the new output.

Note that this code includes error handling to recover from errors in the language model, allowing up to three attempts at generating a new output before giving up. The `merge_with_previous_result` function is used to recover from errors, by merging the previous results with the current input to create a new output.
