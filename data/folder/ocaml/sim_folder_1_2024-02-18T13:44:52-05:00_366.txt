The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Here is an example of OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging large language model prompt workflows:
```python
type 'a stream = { mutable value : 'a; mutable next : 'a stream }

let rec merge_streams op acc streams =
  match streams with
  | [] -> acc
  | h::t ->
    let acc' = op acc h.value in
    h.next <- merge_streams op acc' t;
    acc'

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t ->
    let stream = { value = h; next = None } in
    let folder = { value = stream; next = Some (fold_left op acc t) } in
    merge_streams op acc [folder]

let rec generate_prompts grammar previous examples errors =
  match errors with
  | [] -> previous
  | e :: es ->
    let new_examples = List.map (fun ex -> op grammar ex e) examples in
    if List.length es < 3 then
      generate_prompts grammar new_examples new_examples es
    else
      // handle error

(* Example usage: *)
let grammar = ...
let previous_results = ...
let initial_example = ...
let new_example = ...

let op grammar ex e = ...

let errors = generate_prompts grammar [initial_example] [initial_example] []
```
This code defines a `stream` type to represent an infinite sequence of values, and provides functions for merging multiple streams using a specified operation (`merge_streams`) and folding over a list of values with a binary operator (`fold_left`). The `generate_prompts` function uses these functions to repeatedly generate new examples by applying the operation `op` to the previous results and the most recent error, until no errors remain or a maximum number of attempts have been made.

You can customize this code by defining the `grammar`, `previous_results`, `initial_example`, `new_example`, and `op` functions according to your specific needs. The `op` function should take a grammar, an example, and an error as input and return a new example as output.
