The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an example OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging large language model prompt workflows:
```python
type input = Grammar.t * Previous_results.t * Initial_example.t * New_example.t

type error = Failure of string | Timeout

exception Error of error

let rec merge ~max_errors grammar prev_res initial_ex new_ex =
  let open Grammar in
  let open Previous_results in
  let open Initial_example in
  let open New_example in
  try
    let merged_res =
      fold_left
        (fun acc (k, v) ->
           match Map.find k prev_res with
           | None -> Error (Failure ("Key not found: " ^ k))
           | Some prev_v ->
             if not @@ equal prev_v v then
               Error (Failure ("Value mismatch for key: " ^ k))
             else acc)
        Map.empty
        (Map.to_alist grammar)
    in
    let new_res =
      merge
        ~max_errors:(max max_errors 1)
        {merged_res with data= [initial_ex; new_ex]}
    in
    if Map.cardinal new_res.data > 1 then
      raise (Error (Failure "Multiple examples provided"))
    else
      Ok (Map.find_opt "A" new_res.data |> Option.get)
  with
  | Error e ->
    if max_errors <= 0 then raise e else (
      let open New_example in
      match error with
      | Failure _ ->
        merge ~max_errors:{prev_res with data= [initial_ex; new_ex]}
      | Timeout ->
        merge ~max_errors:{prev_res with data= [initial_ex; new_ex]}
    )
```
This code takes in four inputs: `grammar`, `prev_res`, `initial_ex`, and `new_ex`, where `grammar` is the grammar to be used for merging, `prev_res` is the map of previous results, `initial_ex` is the initial example to use if there are no previous results, and `new_ex` is the new example to merge into the existing results.

The function uses a recursive `fold_left` operation to iterate over each key-value pair in the grammar map, checking that the values for each key match between the previous results and the new example. If there are any mismatches, an error is raised. If all keys match, the new example is merged into the previous results and returned as a new set of results.

If an error occurs during merging, the function checks if there are more errors allowed, and if so, recursively calls itself with updated inputs to try again. If no more errors are allowed or the maximum number of errors has been reached, the function raises the error.

This code can be used as a starting point for implementing the meta magical folder for your high-tech code-based hacking game, and can be customized and extended as needed to suit your specific requirements.
