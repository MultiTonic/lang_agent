The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an example OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging large language model prompt workflows:
```python
type input = {
  grammar : string;
  prev_results : string;
  new_example : string;
}

type output = {
  result : string;
  success : bool;
}

let merge_prompts (inputs : input list) : output =
  let rec aux acc inputs =
    match inputs with
    | [] -> acc
    | h::t ->
      let merged = h.grammar ^ " " ^ h.prev_results ^ " " ^ h.new_example in
      let result = RunLanguageModelPrompt merged in (* replace this with actual function for running language model *)
      aux {result = result; success = true} t
  in
  aux {result = ""; success = false} inputs

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t

let merge_multiple_prompts (inputs : input list list) : output =
  let merged_inputs = List.flatten inputs in
  fold_left merge_prompts {result = ""; success = false} merged_inputs
```
In this code, we define two types: `input` and `output`. The `input` type represents the input to the prompt merger, which consists of a grammar string, previous results string, and a new example. The `output` type represents the result of the prompt merger, which includes the merged output string and a boolean success flag.

The `merge_prompts` function takes a list of inputs and returns a single output after merging them using the specified grammar, previous results, and new example. This function uses a helper function `aux` to recursively process each input in the list, accumulating the merged result as it goes along.

The `fold_left` function is defined as before, but now takes a more complex function `merge_prompts` as its operation. This allows us to merge multiple lists of prompts together using the `merge_multiple_prompts` function.

Note that the actual function for running the language model prompt has been replaced with a placeholder `RunLanguageModelPrompt`, which should be replaced with an actual implementation. Additionally, error handling and retry logic as described in the prompt have not been implemented in this code sample.
