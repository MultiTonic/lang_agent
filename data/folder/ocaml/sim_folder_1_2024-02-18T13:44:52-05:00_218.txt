The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: To create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a large language model, we can build upon the `fold_left` function provided in the initial code snippet. This function applies a given operation repeatedly to an accumulator and a list of elements, from left to right. We can extend this function to create a more sophisticated prompt generation system that incorporates user-defined grammars, previous results, new examples, and error handling.

Here's the OCaml code for the meta magical folder that merges streams of the matrix together into one:

(* A simple record type representing an error *)
type error = {
  message : string;
  attempts_left : int;
}

(* The accumulator is a tuple containing the grammar, the previous results, and the new examples *)
type acc = Grammar.t * (string list) * (string list)

(* The operation applied to the accumulator and an input *)
let op acc input =
  let (grammar, prev_results, new_examples) = acc in
  (* Use the provided grammar to generate a new output from the previous results and new examples *)
  let new_output = Grammar.generate grammar ~prev:prev_results ~new_:new_examples in
  (grammar, new_output :: prev_results, new_examples)

(* The function that applies the operation to a list of inputs and an initial accumulator *)
let rec merge_inputs inputs acc = match inputs with
  | [] -> acc (* If there are no more inputs, return the final accumulator *)
  | h :: t -> (
      try
        let (grammar, new_output, _) = op acc h in
        if Grammar.is_valid new_output then merge_inputs t (grammar, new_output :: fst acc, snd acc)
        else (
          (* If the output is not valid, reduce the number of attempts left and return an error *)
          let { Grammar.max_attempts; _ } = grammar in
          if max_attempts > 0 then
            merge_inputs t { message="Output is invalid, trying again"; attempts_left=(max_attempts - 1) }
          else raise (Failure "Maximum attempts reached")
        )
      with e -> (
        (* If an exception occurs, return the error *)
        let error = { message= Printexc.to_string e; attempts_left=3 } in
        merge_inputs t error
      )
    )

(* The main function to start the prompt generation process *)
let generate ~grammar ~prev_results ~new_examples =
  merge_inputs (List.rev_append new_examples prev_results) { grammar; attempts_left=3 }
