The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging streams of the matrix:
```ocaml
type input = {
  grammar : string;
  previous_results : string;
  new_example : string;
}

type output = {
  merged_text : string;
  is_successful : bool;
}

let merge_inputs inputs =
  let rec fold_left op acc = function
    | []   -> acc
    | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
  in
  let grammar = List.map fst inputs in
  let previous_results = List.map snd inputs in
  let new_examples = List.map (fun (_, _, ex) -> ex) inputs in
  {
    merged_text = fold_left merge_grammar_and_examples "" (List.combine grammar new_examples);
    is_successful = List.for_all (fun x -> x.is_successful) inputs;
  }
and merge_grammar_and_examples acc (grammar, new_example) =
  let merged_text = LanguageModel.generate_description grammar new_example in
  if LanguageModel.test_output merged_text then
    merged_text ^ "\n" ^ acc
  else
    acc

let rec merge_with_errors inputs errors =
  match inputs with
  | [] -> { merged_text = ""; is_successful = List.length errors = 0 }
  | h :: t -> (
      match merge_inputs [h] with
      | { merged_text = good_text; is_successful = true } ->
          merge_with_errors t (errors @ [])
      | { merged_text = error_text; is_successful = false } ->
          if errors < 3 then
            merge_with_errors (t @ [h]) (errors + 1)
          else
            { merged_text = good_text ^ "\n" ^ error_text; is_successful = false }
    )
```
This code defines two types, `input` and `output`, to represent the inputs and outputs of the merge process. The `merge_inputs` function takes a list of inputs and returns an output with the merged text generated from all the inputs. The `fold_left` function is used to iterate through the grammar and new examples in parallel, generating descriptions for each pair using the `LanguageModel.generate_description` function.

The `merge_grammar_and_examples` function takes a partial merged text (accumulator) and a pair of grammar and new example, generates a description using the `LanguageModel.generate_description` function, and tests it with the `LanguageModel.test_output` function. If the output is good, it prepends the generated text to the accumulator; otherwise, it just returns the accumulator.

The `merge_with_errors` function is a helper function that recursively calls `merge_inputs` up to 3 times if an error occurs in generating the description for an input. If all inputs are successful, it simply merges them together and returns the output. Otherwise, it includes the error text in the merged text and sets the success flag to false.

Note that this code is just a starting point and may need further customization and adjustment based on the specific requirements of the game.
