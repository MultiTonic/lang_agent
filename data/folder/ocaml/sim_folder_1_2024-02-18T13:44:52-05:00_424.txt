The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Here is an example OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging large language model prompt workflows:
```ocaml
type result = {
  text: string;
  success: bool;
}

let merge_prompts grammar prev_result new_example max_tries =
  let rec aux acc tries = function
    | [] ->
      if tries > 0 then
        aux { text = ""; success = false } (tries - 1) prev_result.text
      else
        acc
    | h :: t ->
      let merged_example = grammar ^ " " ^ new_example in
      let cmd = Printf.sprintf "echo \"%s\" | ./llm %s" merged_example grammar in
      let result =
        try
          let output = Sys.command cmd in
          if output = 0 then
            { text = String.trim (input_line stdin); success = true }
          else
            { text = ""; success = false }
        with e ->
          { text = Printexc.to_string e; success = false }
      in
      let acc' = if result.success then result.text else prev_result.text in
      aux { text = acc'; success = result.success } tries t
  in
  aux "" max_tries new_example

(* Usage example *)
let grammar = "describe the function of the following code:";;
let prev_result = { text = ""; success = false };;
let new_example = "print('Hello, world!')";;
let merged_result = merge_prompts grammar prev_result new_example 3;;
Printf.printf "Merged result: %s\n" merged_result.text;
```
The `merge_prompts` function takes in the following parameters:

* `grammar`: The grammar to use for generating prompts.
* `prev_result`: The previous result, which contains the text and success status.
* `new_example`: The new example to use for generating a prompt.
* `max_tries`: The maximum number of tries allowed for generating a valid prompt.

The function uses a recursive loop with a helper function `aux` to repeatedly generate prompts by concatenating the grammar and new example, and executing it through the language model command line interface (`./llm` in this case). If a prompt generates a successful result, the merged result is updated. The loop repeats up to `max_tries` times if a successful prompt is not generated.

The resulting merged result is returned as a `result` record.
