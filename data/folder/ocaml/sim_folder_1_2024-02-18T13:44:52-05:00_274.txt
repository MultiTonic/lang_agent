The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an example OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging large language model prompt workflows:
```python
type input = Grammar.t * Previous_results.t * Initial_example.t * New_example.t

let rec merge_prompts : input -> Prompt.t list * Error.t option = fun (grammar, prev_res, initial_ex, new_ex) ->
  let merged_prompts, error = Prompt_merger.merge grammar prev_res.results initial_ex.prompt new_ex.prompt in
  if List.length merged_prompts > 1 then (
    match error with
    | Some e -> (merged_prompts, Some e)
    | None -> (
      let prev_res' = { prev_res with results = merged_prompts } in
      merge_prompts (grammar, prev_res', new_ex, { new_ex with prompt = List.hd merged_prompts })
    )
  ) else (prev_res, error)

let rec play_game : Previous_results.t -> unit = fun prev_res ->
  let grammar = Game_dungeon.create_grammar () in
  let initial_ex = Game_dungeon.create_initial_example () in
  let new_ex, _ = Game_dungeon.generate_new_example grammar prev_res.results initial_ex in
  let merged_prompts, error = merge_prompts (grammar, prev_res, initial_ex, new_ex) in
  match error with
  | Some e -> Printf.printf "Error: %s\n" (Error.to_string e)
  | None -> (
    let language_model = Language_model.create () in
    let descriptions = List.map (Language_model.generate language_model grammar merged_prompts) in
    let new_results = { prev_res with results = descriptions } in
    Game_dungeon.display_dungeon descriptions;
    play_game new_results
  )
```
The `merge_prompts` function takes an input consisting of a grammar, previous results, initial example, and new example, and merges the prompts using a prompt merger module (to be implemented separately). If there are multiple merged prompts, it recursively calls itself with the first merged prompt as the new example.

The `play_game` function implements the game loop, where it generates new prompts based on the previous results and current grammar, merges them using the `merge_prompts` function, displays the dungeon using the descriptions generated by the language model, and recursively calls itself with the updated previous results.

Note that this is just an example implementation, and may need to be adapted to fit your specific use case.
