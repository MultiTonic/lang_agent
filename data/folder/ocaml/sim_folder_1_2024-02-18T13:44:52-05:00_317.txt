The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: To create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a large language model, we can use a folding function to combine the different inputs and iteratively refine the prompt. Here's an OCaml code snippet that implements this:
```ocaml
type input = Grammar of string | PreviousResults of string | NewExample of string

let merge_inputs acc = function
  | Grammar a -> (a, "grammar")
  | PreviousResults d -> (d, "previous results")
  | NewExample c -> (c, "new example")

let rec fold_left op acc inputs =
  match inputs with
  | [] -> acc
  | h :: t ->
    let (input, desc) = merge_inputs h in
    let new_acc = op acc input in
    let output = Printf.sprintf "%s: %s\n" desc input in
    Printf.printf "  %s" output;
    fold_left op new_acc t

let rec generate_prompt grammar prev_res new_ex example_cnt max_iter =
  let test_prompt prompt =
    (* Test the generated prompt here and return true if it's good, false otherwise *)
    true
  in
  let inputs = [ Grammar grammar; PreviousResults prev_res; NewExample new_ex ] in
  let init_acc = Printf.sprintf "Initial example: %s\n" new_ex in
  let acc = ref init_acc in
  let i = ref 0 in
  while not (test_prompt !acc) && !i < max_iter do
    let new_ex = if !i > 0 then "..." else new_ex in
    acc := fold_left (fun a _ -> a ^ "\n") !acc inputs;
    incr i;
  done;
  !acc

let () =
  let grammar = "A" in
  let prev_res = "D" in
  let new_ex = "B" in
  let max_iter = 3 in
  let prompt = generate_prompt grammar prev_res new_ex "Initial code example" max_iter in
  Printf.printf "\nFinal prompt:\n%s\n" prompt
```
This code defines a custom `input` type, which can be either a `Grammar`, `PreviousResults`, or `NewExample`. The `merge_inputs` function processes each input and returns the input value along with its description. The `fold_left` function is used to iteratively refine the prompt based on the different inputs.

The `generate_prompt` function takes a grammar, previous results, new example, initial code example, maximum number of iterations, and tests the generated prompt using the `test_prompt` function (which should be implemented to test the quality of the prompt). If the prompt is not good enough, it updates the new example and repeats the process until a satisfactory prompt is generated or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

You can customize this code according to your needs by modifying the `input` type, `merge_inputs`, `fold_left`, and `generate_prompt` functions as well as the `test_prompt` function.
