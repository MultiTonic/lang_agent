The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging large language model prompt workflows:
```ocaml
type result = {
  text : string;
  success : bool;
}

let merge_prompts grammar initial previous new_examples max_errors =
  let rec aux acc examples errors_left = function
    | [] ->
      if List.for_all (fun r -> r.success) examples then
        { text = List.map (fun r -> r.text) examples |> String.concat ""; success = true }
      else
        { text = "Error: Failed to generate valid prompt"; success = false }
    | h :: t ->
      let result = LanguageModel.generate_prompt grammar h in
      if result.success then
        aux (result :: acc) (result :: examples) errors_left t
      else if errors_left > 0 then
        aux acc examples (errors_left - 1) t
      else
        { text = "Error: Failed to generate valid prompt after 3 attempts"; success = false }
  in
  let rec fold_results acc results = function
    | [] -> acc
    | h :: t ->
      if h.success then
        fold_results (h.text :: acc) (h :: results) t
      else
        fold_results acc results t
  in
  let merged_prompt =
    aux [] [initial] max_errors (previous @ new_examples)
  in
  { text = "Merged Prompt:\n" ^ merged_prompt.text; success = merged_prompt.success },
  fold_results [] [merged_prompt] [merged_prompt]

(* Usage example: *)
let grammar = "A";;
let initial = { text = "B"; success = true };;
let previous = [{ text = "D1"; success = true }];;
let new_examples = [{ text = "C1"; success = true }; { text = "C2"; success = false }];;
let max_errors = 3;;

let merged_prompt, results = merge_prompts grammar initial previous new_examples max_errors;;
Printf.printf "Merged Prompt:\n%s\nSuccess: %b\n" merged_prompt.text merged_prompt.success;
List.iter (fun r -> Printf.printf "%s\nSuccess: %b\n" r.text r.success) results;
```
The `merge_prompts` function takes in the following parameters:

* `grammar`: The grammar to be used for generating prompts.
* `initial`: The initial prompt to start merging from.
* `previous`: A list of previously generated prompts that have been merged.
* `new_examples`: A list of new prompts to be merged.
* `max_errors`: The maximum number of errors allowed before giving up on a prompt.

The function returns two values: the merged prompt, and a list of all generated prompts (both successful and unsuccessful) during the merging process.

The implementation uses two auxiliary functions:

* `aux`: This function recursively applies the language model's generate\_prompt function to each example in the input list, while keeping track of the best result so far. If a result fails validation more than `max_errors` times, it is discarded and the next one is tried.
* `fold_results`: This function folds over the list of generated prompts, accumulating only the successful ones.

The implementation also includes an example usage of the `merge_prompts` function. Note that this example uses a mock language model implementation (LanguageModel.generate\_prompt) for demonstration purposes only.
