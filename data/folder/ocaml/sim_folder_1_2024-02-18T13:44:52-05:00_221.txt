The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging streams of the matrix:
```ocaml
type input = {
  grammar : string;
  prev_results : string;
  new_example : string;
}

type output = {
  result : string;
  is_good : bool;
}

let merge_inputs inputs =
  List.map (fun input -> (input, merge_examples input.new_example input.prev_results)) inputs

and merge_examples example prev_results =
  let rec merge_sequences seq1 seq2 acc =
    match seq1, seq2 with
    | [], _ -> List.rev acc, seq2
    | _, [] -> List.rev acc, seq1
    | h1 :: t1, h2 :: t2 ->
      if h1 = h2 then
        merge_sequences t1 t2 (h1 :: acc)
      else if h1 < h2 then
        merge_sequences t1 seq2 (h1 :: acc)
      else
        merge_sequences seq1 t2 (h2 :: acc)
  in
  let merged_seq, _ = merge_sequences (List.of_string example) (List.of_string prev_results) [] in
  let merged_str = String.concat "" (List.map string_of_char merged_seq) in
  { result = merged_str; is_good = true }

let rec merge_left op acc inputs =
  match inputs with
  | [] -> acc
  | h :: t ->
    let new_acc = op acc (merge_examples h.new_example h.prev_results) in
    if h.is_good then
      merge_left op new_acc t
    else
      let rec try_again inputs =
        match inputs with
        | [] -> new_acc
        | h' :: t' ->
          let new_acc' = op acc (merge_examples h'.new_example h'.prev_results) in
          if h'.is_good then
            try_again t'
          else
            merge_left op new_acc' (t @ [h'])
      in
      try_again (h :: t)
```
The `merge_inputs` function takes a list of inputs, where each input contains a grammar, previous results, and a new example. It merges the new examples with the previous results using the `merge_examples` function, and returns a list of merged outputs along with their corresponding inputs.

The `merge_examples` function takes a new example and previous results as input, and merges them into a single sequence by interleaving the characters based on their order. It then converts the merged sequence back into a string and returns it as the result, along with a boolean indicating whether the merge was successful (i.e., if the new example was compatible with the previous results).

The `merge_left` function takes an operator `op`, an accumulator `acc`, and a list of inputs, and applies the operator to each merged output in turn, updating the accumulator as it goes. If a merge is not successful, it tries up to three times to generate a new example that is compatible with the previous results.

This code can be used as follows:
```ocaml
let grammar = "A"
let prev_results = "B"
let new_example = "C"

let inputs = [
  { grammar; prev_results; new_example };
  { grammar; prev_results = new_example; new_example = "D" };
  { grammar; prev_results = new_example; new_example = "E" };
]

let op acc input = merge_examples input.new_example input.prev_results

let merged_outputs = merge_left op { result = ""; is_good = true } inputs
```
This will merge the examples `C`, `D`, and `E` into a single sequence based on the grammar `A`, starting with the previous results `B`. The resulting merged outputs, along with their corresponding inputs, are stored in the `merged_outputs` variable.
