The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an example OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging large language model prompt workflows:
```ocaml
type input = {
  grammar : string;
  prev_results : string;
  new_example : string;
}

type output = {
  result : string;
  success : bool;
}

let merge_prompts (inputs : input list) : output =
  let rec fold_left op acc = function
    | []   -> acc
    | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
  in
  let folder op acc input =
    let new_output = LanguageModel.generate_description ~grammar:input.grammar ~prev_results:input.prev_results ~new_example:input.new_example in
    if LanguageModel.test_description new_output then
      { result = new_output; success = true }
    else if LanguageModel.feedback_possible then
      let feedback = LanguageModel.get_feedback new_output in
      { result = LanguageModel.apply_feedback feedback new_output; success = false }
    else
      acc
  in
  { result = ""; success = false }
  |> fold_left folder
```
This code defines two types, `input` and `output`, to represent the input data and the output results of the merge process. The `merge_prompts` function takes a list of `input` records, each containing the necessary information for generating a new description (i.e., grammar, previous results, and new example).

The `merge_prompts` function uses a helper function called `fold_left`, which is similar to the one you provided in your code. The difference is that this version of `fold_left` takes an additional argument, `op`, which represents the operation to be applied to each element in the list.

The `merge_prompts` function also defines a nested function called `folder`, which applies the language model to generate a new description for each input record. If the generated description is successful (i.e., it passes the test), it returns an `output` record with the new description and a success flag set to true.

If the generated description is unsuccessful, the function checks if feedback is possible. If so, it retrieves feedback from the language model and applies it to the unsuccessful description. It then returns an `output` record with the updated description and a success flag set to false.

If feedback is not possible, the function simply returns the original output record with the empty result string and a failure flag set to false.

The `merge_prompts` function initializes the accumulator variable as an empty string and a failure flag, and then applies the `folder` operation to each element in the input list using `fold_left`. The final output is returned as an `output` record containing the merged result string and a success flag.
