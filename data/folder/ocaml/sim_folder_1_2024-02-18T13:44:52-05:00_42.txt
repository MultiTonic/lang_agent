The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here's an OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging large language model prompt workflows:
```ocaml
type input = {
  grammar : string;
  prev_results : string;
  new_example : string;
}

type output = {
  result : string;
  error : string option;
}

let try_generate ~max_attempts generator input =
  let rec aux attempt input =
    let result = generator input in
    if String.length result > 0 then
      Ok { result; error = None }
    else if attempt < max_attempts then
      aux (attempt + 1) input
    else
      Error "Failed to generate a valid output"
  in
  aux 0 input

let merge_workflows generator input =
  let open Option.Monad_infix in
  let open Error.Monad_infix in
  let rec aux acc input = function
    | [] -> acc
    | h :: t ->
      let+ { result; error } = try_generate ~max_attempts:3 generator (input, h) in
      aux (result :: acc) (if Option.is_none error then input else { input with new_example = result }) t
  in
  aux [] input

let test_merge_workflows () =
  let generator _input =
    (* Implement your large language model prompt workflow here *)
    "Generated output"
  in
  let input = { grammar = ""; prev_results = ""; new_example = "" } in
  let merged_output = merge_workflows generator input in
  match merged_output with
  | Ok outputs ->
    List.iter (fun output ->
        (* Process the generated outputs here *)
        Printf.printf "Output: %s\n" output.result)
      outputs
  | Error e ->
    Printf.printf "Error: %s\n" e
```
In this code, we define an `input` record type that contains the necessary inputs for generating a prompt workflow. We also define an `output` record type that stores the generated result and any error messages.

We then define a `try_generate` function that attempts to generate a valid output from the given generator up to a maximum number of attempts. If a valid output is generated, it returns an `Ok` value containing the output. Otherwise, it returns an `Error` value with a message indicating failure.

The `merge_workflows` function takes a generator and an input record as arguments. It uses the `try_generate` function to attempt to generate valid outputs for each grammar in the list of grammars. If a generated output is valid, it updates the input record with the new example and continues processing the rest of the grammars. If all grammars have been processed, it returns a list of the generated outputs.

Finally, we define a `test_merge_workflows` function that tests the `merge_workflows` function with a sample generator. This function should be modified to use your specific large language model prompt workflow generator. The generated outputs are printed to the console for demonstration purposes.
