The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging streams of the matrix:
```ocaml
type input = {
  grammar : string;
  prev_results : string;
  new_example : string;
}

type output = {
  result : string;
  is_good : bool;
}

let merge_inputs inputs =
  let folder acc input =
    let {grammar; prev_results; new_example} = input in
    let folded = fold_left (fun acc x -> acc ^ x) "" (List.map String.concat [[" "; grammar; "\n"; prev_results; new_example]] inputs) in
    {result = folded; is_good = true}
  in
  List.fold_left folder {result=""; is_good=false} inputs

let rec merge_and_test inputs n =
  let merged_input = merge_inputs inputs in
  if merged_input.is_good then
    merged_input
  else if n > 0 then
    merge_and_test inputs (n-1)
  else
    {result=""; is_good=false}
```
The `merge_inputs` function takes a list of input records, where each record contains the grammar, previous results, and new example to be merged. The function uses the `fold_left` higher-order function to concatenate all the inputs together into a single string, which is returned as the merged result.

The `merge_and_test` function takes a list of input records and the maximum number of times to retry merging if the result is not good. It first calls `merge_inputs` to merge all the inputs together. If the merged result is good (i.e., the language model can parse and generate output from it), then it returns the merged result. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself up to the maximum number of retries allowed, each time merging the inputs again in hopes that a different combination will be successful.

You can use this code to merge streams of input for your large language model and test the results until you get one that is good. You can then repeat the loop with the new merged result as the previous result, adding new examples as needed. This process creates a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for your language model.
