The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Here is an example of OCaml code that implements a fold\_left function and uses it to merge large language model prompt workflows:
```
let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t

let merge_workflows grammar prev\_result new\_example =
  let merged\_result = fold_left (fun acc x -> x) prev\_result (List.map (fun e -> generate\_prompt grammar e) [prev_result; new_example]) in
  if is\_valid\_output merged\_result then
    merged_result
  else if num_attempts < 3 then
    merge_workflows grammar prev_result (generate\_error\_prompt grammar prev\_result)
  else
    failwith "Max attempts reached, unable to merge workflows"

let rec generate\_prompt grammar example =
  (* Generate a new prompt using the provided grammar and example *)
  ...

let is\_valid\_output output =
  (* Check if the generated output is valid for use in the game *)
  ...

let generate\_error\_prompt grammar prev\_result =
  (* Generate a new example to try to correct the error in the previous result *)
  ...
```
The `merge_workflows` function takes as input the current grammar, the previous results and the new example. It then uses the `fold_left` function to apply the `generate_prompt` function to each element of the list containing both the previous result and the new example. The resulting merged\_result is then checked for validity using the `is_valid_output` function. If it is not valid, the function will try to generate a new example by calling the `generate_error_prompt` function up to 3 times before giving up.

The `generate_prompt`, `is_valid_output`, and `generate_error_prompt` are functions that need to be implemented according to your specific use case, these functions will help you generate new prompt using the provided grammar and example, check if the generated output is valid for use in the game, and generate a new example to try to correct the error in the previous result respectively.

Please note that this is an example and it may not fit your specific needs and you might need to modify or add more functionality according to your requirements.
