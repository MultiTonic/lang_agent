The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t

 Result: To create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a large language model in a high-tech code-based hacking game, we can extend the `fold_left` function to include the required inputs and functionality. Here's an OCaml code snippet that should suit our needs:

```ocaml
type input = {
  grammar : string;
  prev_results : string;
  new_example : string;
}

type output = {
  result : string;
  is_good : bool;
}

let rec merge_prompts input attempts_left =
  let { grammar; prev_results; new_example } = input in
  let folded_examples =
    List.fold_left
      (fun acc example -> op acc (example, grammar) in
        if Str.string_match (Str.regexp "error") example 0 then
          { result = prev_results; is_good = false }
        else
          { result = example; is_good = true })
      { result = prev_results; is_good = true }
      [prev_results; new_example]
  in
  if folded_examples.is_good then
    if attempts_left > 1 then
      merge_prompts { grammar; prev_results = folded_examples.result; new_example } (attempts_left - 1)
    else
      folded_examples
  else
    merge_prompts input (attempts_left - 1)
```

In this code snippet, we define the `input` and `output` types to represent the inputs to the function and the resulting output. The `merge_prompts` function takes an input record and the number of attempts left for generating new examples. It uses a modified version of the `fold_left` function, which applies the `op` function to each example string and checks if it contains an error. If it does, it sets the output's `is_good` field to false and returns it. Otherwise, it continues folding until all examples have been processed.

The function then recursively calls itself with a reduced number of attempts left if the current output is not good. If the output is good or there are no more attempts left, it returns the final output record. This allows for up to three attempts to generate new examples before feeding an error back to create a new output.

This function should provide a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a large language model in a high-tech code-based hacking game, where players explore a dungeon of knowledge generated using the language model and a proof engine.
