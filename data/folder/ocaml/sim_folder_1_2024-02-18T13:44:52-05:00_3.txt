The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an example OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging streams of the matrix:
```ocaml
type input = Grammar.t * Previous_results.t * New_example.t
type output = Result.t * Previous_results.t

let rec merge_matrices ~max_errors:max_errors (input : input) =
  let grammar, previous_results, new_example = input in
  let merged_matrix, _ = fold_left merge_functions merged_matrix [grammar; previous_results; new_example] in
  let result = check_merged_matrix merged_matrix in
  match result with
  | Ok _ -> (result, previous_results)
  | Error _ ->
    if max_errors > 0 then
      merge_matrices ~max_errors:(max_errors - 1) input
    else
      (Error "Max errors reached", previous_results)
and merge_functions matrix = function
  | Grammar grammar -> merge_grammar matrix grammar
  | Previous_results prev_results -> merge_previous_results matrix prev_results
  | New_example new_example -> merge_new_example matrix new_example
and merge_grammar matrix grammar =
  (* Merge the grammar with the current merged matrix *)
  ...
and merge_previous_results matrix prev_results =
  (* Merge the previous results with the current merged matrix *)
  ...
and merge_new_example matrix new_example =
  (* Merge the new example with the current merged matrix *)
  ...
and check_merged_matrix matrix =
  (* Check if the merged matrix is valid and return either Ok or Error *)
  ...
```
The `merge_matrices` function takes an input of type `input`, which consists of a grammar, previous results, and new example. It recursively calls itself up to `max_errors` times if there are errors in the merged matrix until it reaches a valid merged matrix or exceeds the maximum number of allowed errors.

The `merge_functions` function is used to merge each individual input with the current merged matrix using functions such as `merge_grammar`, `merge_previous_results`, and `merge_new_example`. These functions perform specific operations for merging each type of input.

Finally, the `check_merged_matrix` function checks if the merged matrix is valid and returns either an Ok or Error result.
