The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an example OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging streams of the matrix:

let rec fold\_left op acc = function
| [] -> acc
| h::t ->
let acc' = op acc h in
try
let res = merge\_streams acc' in
fold\_left op res t
with
| Merge\_Error e ->
if num\_attempts <= 3 then (
num\_attempts := num\_attempts + 1;
fold\_left op acc t
) else raise e
| exn -> raise exn

where "merge\_streams" is a function that takes the current accumulator value and merges it with the new example to form a new output. This function should be implemented according to the specific requirements of your application. The "Merge\_Error" exception represents any errors that may occur during the merge process, such as if the grammar or examples are invalid.

The "num\_attempts" variable is used to keep track of the number of attempts made to merge the streams. If a merge fails, this value is incremented and the function tries again with the same accumulator value. If three attempts fail, the function raises the Merge\_Error exception.

You can customize this code by defining your own "merge\_streams" function and adjusting the number of attempts allowed before raising an error.
