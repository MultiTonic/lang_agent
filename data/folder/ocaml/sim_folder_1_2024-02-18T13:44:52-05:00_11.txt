The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an example OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging large language model prompt workflows:
```sql
type input = {
  grammar : string;
  prev_results : string;
  new_example : string;
}

type output = {
  merged_prompt : string;
  success : bool;
}

let merge_prompts input =
  let { grammar; prev_results; new_example } = input in
  let rec merge_attempts acc n =
    if n = 0 then (
      { merged_prompt = ""; success = false },
      "Exceeded maximum number of attempts"
    )
    else if LanguageModel.validatePrompt acc then (
      { merged_prompt = acc; success = true },
      ""
    ) else merge_attempts (LanguageModel.mergePrompts acc new_example grammar) (n - 1)
  in
  let (output, error_msg) = merge_attempts prev_results 3 in
  { merged_prompt = output.merged_prompt; success = output.success },
  error_msg

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | [] -> acc
  | h :: t ->
      let input = {
        grammar = h.grammar;
        prev_results = acc;
        new_example = h.new_example;
      } in
      let (output, error_msg) = merge_prompts input in
      if output.success then fold_left op output.merged_prompt t
      else failwith ("Error merging prompts: " ^ error_msg)
```
In this code, we define types for the input and output of the `merge_prompts` function. The input type includes fields for the grammar, previous results, and new example to be merged into the prompt. The output type includes a field for the merged prompt and another for whether or not the merge was successful.

The `merge_prompts` function takes an input as an argument and attempts to merge the new example with the previous results up to three times using the `LanguageModel.mergePrompts` function, which implements the actual merging logic. If a successful merge is achieved, the merged prompt is returned along with a success flag. Otherwise, an error message is returned.

The `fold_left` function is used to recursively apply the `merge_prompts` function to each input in a list, using the previous results as the accumulator for the next iteration of the loop. If a merge attempt fails, an exception is raised with an error message.

This code can be customized further to suit the specific needs of the language model and the high-tech code-based hacking game. For example, the `LanguageModel.mergePrompts` function could be replaced with another implementation, or additional checks could be added to ensure that the merged prompt meets certain quality criteria before being used as the new previous results for the next iteration of the loop.
