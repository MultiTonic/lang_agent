The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: To create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a large language model, we can build upon the `fold_left` function provided in the code snippet. This function recursively applies a given operation to each element of a list, accumulating the results in an accumulator parameter.

We can extend this idea to create a prompt generator that accepts a list of input configurations and generates prompts based on those inputs. To do this, let's define some data types for our game elements:

```ocaml
type grammar = string
type previous_result = string
type new_example = string
type output = string

type config = {
  grammar : grammar;
  prev_result : previous_result;
  new_example : new_example;
}
```

Next, let's define a function that applies an input configuration to the prompt generator:

```ocaml
let apply_config config acc =
  let open Config in
  let { grammar; prev_result; new_example } = config in
  let new_output = generate_prompt grammar prev_result new_example in
  (new_output, test_output new_output) :: acc
```

Here, `generate_prompt` and `test_output` are hypothetical functions that you would need to implement based on your specific requirements for generating prompts and testing their quality.

Now, let's define a function that applies the `apply_config` function to each element of a list of input configurations:

```ocaml
let rec fold_configs op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_configs op (op (h, acc) h) t

let generate_prompts configs =
  let num_attempts = 3 in
  let initial_acc = ([], false) in
  let final_acc = fold_configs apply_config initial_acc configs in
  List.map fst final_acc
```

The `generate_prompts` function takes a list of input configurations and applies the `apply_config` function to each element of the list, using the `fold_configs` function to accumulate the results. The resulting list of prompts is then returned by the function.

You can use this framework as a starting point for building your game's prompt generator, customizing it to fit your specific needs and requirements.
