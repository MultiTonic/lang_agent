The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: To create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a large language model, we can build upon the `fold_left` function provided in the OCaml code. This function applies a given operation recursively to each element of a list, accumulating the results in an accumulator value.

We will extend this function with additional parameters and create a new function called `merge_prompts`, which takes as input:

* `initial_grammar`: The initial grammar rules for generating prompts.
* `previous_results`: The previous results generated by the language model.
* `new_examples`: New examples to incorporate into the prompt generation process.
* `max_iterations`: The maximum number of iterations allowed for refining prompts based on errors.
* `op`: A function that combines the current input, previous results, and new examples to generate a new set of prompts.

Here's the OCaml code for the `merge_prompts` function:

```ocaml
let max_iterations = 3

let rec merge_prompts ~initial_grammar ~previous_results ~new_examples ~op =
  let acc = previous_results in
  match new_examples with
  | [] -> acc
  | h :: t ->
    try
      let new_acc = op acc initial_grammar h in
      if List.length t < max_iterations then
        merge_prompts ~initial_grammar ~previous_results:new_acc ~new_examples:t ~op
      else
        new_acc
    with
    | e ->
      if List.length t < max_iterations then
        merge_prompts ~initial_grammar ~previous_results:acc ~new_examples:t ~op
      else
        acc
```

In this function, `op` is a higher-order function that combines the current input (previous results and new examples) to generate a new set of prompts. The `try...with` block allows for error handling during the refinement process, ensuring that the number of iterations does not exceed the maximum allowed.

Now you can use this function to merge large language model prompt workflows by providing an appropriate `op` function based on your specific requirements.
