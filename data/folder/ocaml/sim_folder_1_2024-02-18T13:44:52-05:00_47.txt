The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: To create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a large language model, we can build upon the `fold_left` function provided in the OCaml code snippet. The purpose of this function is to iterate over a list and apply an operation to each element in the list, accumulating the results along the way.

In our case, the input will be a list of configurations containing grammar, previous results, and new examples. We'll define a custom operation that takes the current configuration and produces a new one by merging the previous results with the new example and testing the output. If the output is good, it will continue iterating over the list with the updated previous results; otherwise, it will attempt to create a new D up to three times before giving up.

Here's an OCaml code snippet that implements this system:

```ocaml
type config = {
  grammar : string;
  prev_results : string;
  new_example : string;
}

let custom_operation config =
  let open Config in
  let {grammar; prev_results; new_example} = config in
  
  (* Generate a new output by combining the previous results and new example *)
  let new_output = /* your code here */ in
  
  (* Test the new output *)
  if is_good_output new_output then
    {grammar; prev_results=new_output; new_example}
  else
    let rec create_new_output i config =
      if i > 3 then
        raise (Failure "Failed to create a good output after 3 attempts")
      else
        let new_output = /* your code here */ in
        if is_good_output new_output then
          {grammar; prev_results=new_output; new_example}
        else
          create_new_output (i+1) config
    in
    create_new_output 1 config

let rec fold_configs op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_configs op (op acc h) t

(* Initialize the list of configurations *)
let initial_configs = [ {grammar="A"; prev_results="D"; new_example="B"} ] in

(* Fold over the list of configurations to generate a final output *)
let final_output = fold_configs custom_operation (Config.{grammar="init"; prev_results="init"; new_example="init"}) initial_configs
```

In this code, you will need to implement the following:

1. The `Config` module with a record type containing the necessary fields and helper functions for manipulating the records.
2. The function `is_good_output` that checks whether an output is good or not.
3. The part of the code in `custom_operation` that generates the new output by combining `prev_results` and `new_example`, as well as the part where you attempt to create a new output up to three times if the initial one is not good.
