The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an example OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging streams of the matrix:
```ocaml
type 'a stream = Cons of 'a * 'a stream | Nil

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | Nil   -> acc
  | Cons (h, t) -> fold_left op (op acc h) t

let merge_streams gramma streams =
  let folder op acc = function
    | Cons (ex, rest) when is_valid_example gramma ex ->
        let new_acc = apply_grammar gramma acc ex in
        Cons (new_acc, rest)
    | _ -> acc
  in
  fold_left folder Nil streams

let rec run_merge_loop gramma previous_results initial_examples max_tries =
  let streams = create_streams initial_examples in
  let result = merge_streams gramma streams in
  match result with
  | Cons (output, rest) ->
      if is_good_result output then
        run_merge_loop gramma (Cons (output, previous_results)) initial_examples max_tries
      else if max_tries > 0 then
        run_merge_loop gramma previous_results (Cons (create_error_example gramma previous_results, rest)) (max_tries - 1)
      else
        Cons (create_error_example gramma previous_results, previous_results)
  | Nil -> failwith "Impossible: merge_streams returned Nil"
```
This code defines a `merge_streams` function that takes a grammar and a list of streams as input. It applies the grammar to each example in the streams using a left fold, and returns a new stream containing the results. The `run_merge_loop` function implements the described behavior for handling errors and retrying up to three times.

The code uses a simple stream data type defined as a cons list (`Cons` constructor) or an empty list (`Nil`). The functions `create_streams`, `is_valid_example`, `apply_grammar`, `is_good_result`, and `create_error_example` are not implemented in this example, and should be customized to fit the specific needs of your application.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows using large language models, with error handling and retry logic built-in. The resulting merged streams can be used as input to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
