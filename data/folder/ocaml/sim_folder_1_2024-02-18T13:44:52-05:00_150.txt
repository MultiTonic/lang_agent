The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an example OCaml code that implements a meta magical folder for merging large language model prompt workflows:
```ocaml
type input = {
  grammar : string;
  prev_results : string;
  new_example : string;
}

type output = {
  result : string;
  is_good : bool;
}

let merge_prompts (inputs : input list) : output =
  let folder op acc input =
    let open Option.Monad_infix in
    let* prev_results = acc >>| Lazy.force in
    let new_example = input.new_example in
    let new_results = run_language_model ~grammar:input.grammar ~prev_results ~new_example in
    let is_good = test_results new_results in
    if is_good then
      Some (new_results, true)
    else if Lazy.force acc >>| Option.is_some <> Some false then (
      let* prev_results = acc >>| Lazy.force in
      let new_results = merge_previous_and_new_results prev_results new_results in
      Some (new_results, is_good)
    ) else (
      None
    )
  in
  let init = lazy ({ result = ""; is_good = false; }) in
  List.fold_left folder ~init inputs >>| fun acc -> Option.get acc
```
This code defines a new `merge_prompts` function that takes a list of `input` records, each containing the grammar, previous results, and new example for a single prompt workflow. The function uses a fold operation to iterate over the inputs and merge their results using an accumulator initialized to an empty result and a flag indicating whether the current results are good or not.

At each iteration, the folder function first checks if there are previous results available in the accumulator. If not, it runs the language model with the input's new example and returns the new results as the updated accumulator value. If there are previous results available, the folder function merges them with the new results using a `merge_previous_and_new_results` helper function (not shown here).

If the merged results pass the test, the folder function updates the accumulator to contain the new results and sets the good flag to true. If not, it checks if there are any previous results that passed the test. If so, it merges them with the current results using the helper function and returns the updated accumulator value. If not, it returns None, indicating that no valid result could be produced after three attempts.

The `merge_prompts` function then forces the initial accumulator lazy value and returns the final merged results as a record containing both the result string and the good flag.

Note that this code is just an example and may need to be adapted to fit your specific use case. In particular, you will need to define the `run_language_model` and `test_results` functions, as well as any necessary helpers such as `merge_previous_and_new_results`.
