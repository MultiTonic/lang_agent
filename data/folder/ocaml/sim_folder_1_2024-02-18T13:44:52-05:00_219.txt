The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.
*)

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here's an OCaml code that implements a meta-magical folder for merging streams of prompts and previous results, which can be used for generating creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high-tech code-based hacking game:
```ocaml
type input = {
  grammar : string;
  prev_results : string;
  new_example : string;
}

type output = {
  merged : string;
  tested : bool;
}

let rec merge_prompts acc input =
  let {grammar; prev_results; new_example} = input in
  let merged = prev_results ^ "\n" ^ grammar ^ "\n" ^ new_example in
  {merged = merged; tested = false}
  
let rec test_output output =
  if output.tested then output
  else
    let result = test_model output.merged in (* replace this with actual test function *)
    {output with tested = true; merged = result}
    
let rec fold_left op acc inputs =
  match inputs with
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc (merge_prompts acc h)) t
  
let rec merge_and_test inputs =
  let merged_output = fold_left merge_prompts {merged=""; tested=false} inputs in
  test_output merged_output
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* The `input` and `output` types are defined to represent the input parameters for merging prompts and the resulting output respectively.
* The `merge_prompts` function takes two inputs - accumulator (previous output) and current input, and returns a new output with the merged prompt string.
* The `test_output` function tests the given output by running it through a test model (which needs to be defined separately), and updates the output accordingly. It also ensures that the testing is done only once per output.
* The `fold_left` function applies the `merge_prompts` operation repeatedly on all inputs, starting with an initial accumulator value.
* The `merge_and_test` function merges all prompts using `fold_left`, and then tests the resulting output using `test_output`.

This code can be further customized to suit specific needs, such as adding error handling or modifying the test model.
