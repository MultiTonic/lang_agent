The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*
folder

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate ocaml code to do the merge of large language model prompt workflows.

 Result: Here is an example of OCaml code that implements a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a large language model, based on the description provided:
```ocaml
type input = { grammar : string; prev_results : string; new_example : string }

let merge_inputs input1 input2 =
  {
    grammar = input1.grammar ^ " " ^ input2.grammar;
    prev_results = input2.prev_results;
    new_example = input2.new_example;
  }

let rec generate_prompt inputs acc =
  match inputs with
  | [] -> acc
  | h :: t ->
      let merged_inputs = merge_inputs h acc in
      let new_output = large_language_model merged_inputs in
      if is_good new_output then generate_prompt t { merged_inputs with prev_results = new_output }
      else if num_attempts < 3 then generate_prompt (h :: t) acc
      else failwith "Max attempts reached"

let start_generating grammar initial_example =
  let initial_input = { grammar; prev_results = initial_example; new_example = "" } in
  generate_prompt [initial_input] initial_input
```
This code defines three types: `input`, which represents the input to the function, including the grammar, previous results, and new example; `merge_inputs`, which takes two inputs and merges them into a single input with an updated grammar string; and `generate_prompt`, which recursively generates prompts using a large language model based on the given inputs.

The `start_generating` function initializes the process by creating an initial input with the provided grammar and initial example, then starts the `generate_prompt` loop to generate new prompts. The loop continues until it reaches the maximum number of attempts or a good output is generated.
