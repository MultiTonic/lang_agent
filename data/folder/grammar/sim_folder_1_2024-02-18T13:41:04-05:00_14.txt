This grammar allows for generating different paths through the levels of the world, as well as descriptions of various elements in each level. The "*" symbol can be used to represent a random or unknown level, and the adjectives and nouns can be customized and expanded as needed.

To generate a prompt, a path and one or more descriptions can be combined, for example:

"Explore the /physical/passage, where you encounter a dark corridor. In the shimmering room, find a mysterious artifact that can help you on your journey."
