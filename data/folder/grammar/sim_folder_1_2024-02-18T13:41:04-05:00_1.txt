 Result: Sure, I can help you generate a grammar for creating prompts for your hacker game dungeon using EBNF notation. Here is a possible grammar that describes a path through the quasi-fibers of ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) starting at the physical level and going all the way to the spiritual and back:

```
<path> ::= <physical_object> | <physical_object> "->" <path>

<physical_object> ::= "#" <object_name> ["("[<properties>]")"]

<properties> ::= <property> ["," <properties>]

<property> ::= <property_name> "=" <property_value>

<property_name> ::= /[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*/

<property_value> ::= <number> | <string> | <boolean> | <object> | <array> | <function>

<number> ::= ["+"|"-"] <digit> [<digits>] ["." <digits>] [e|E ["+"] <digit> [<digits>]]

<string> ::= "\"" <characters> "\""

<characters> ::= <character> [<characters>]

<character> ::= ~["\"\\\]

<boolean> ::= "true" | "false"

<object> ::= "{" ["#" <property_name> ":" <property_value> ["," <properties>]] "}"

<array> ::= "[" [<elements>] "]"

<elements> ::= <element> ["," <elements>]

<element> ::= <property_value> | "#" <property_name>

<function> ::= "[function" <parameters> "]" <statements> "[endfunction]"

<parameters> ::= ["(" <parameter_name> ["," <parameters>] ")"]

<parameter_name> ::= /[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*/

<statements> ::= <statement> [";" <statements>]

<statement> ::= <assignment> | <if_statement> | <while_statement> | <for_statement> | <return_statement> | <call_statement>

<assignment> ::= "#" <variable_name> "=" <expression>

<variable_name> ::= /[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*/

<if_statement> ::= "if" <condition> "then" <statements> ["else" <statements>] "end"

<while_statement> ::= "while" <condition> "repeat" <statements> "end"

<for_statement> ::= "for" "#" <variable_name> "=" <start> "to" <end> ["step" <step>] "do" <statements> "end"

<return_statement> ::= "return" [<expression>] ";"

<call_statement> ::= "[invoke" <function_name> "(" <arguments> ")]"

<arguments> ::= ["#" <argument_name> ["," <arguments>]]

<argument_name> ::= /[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*/

<expression> ::= <term> [<add_op> <expression>]

<term> ::= <factor> [<mul_op> <term>]

<factor> ::= <primary> | "!" <factor> | "-" <factor>

<primary> ::= <literal> | "#" <variable_name> | "[access" "#" <object_name> "." <property_name> "]" | "[call" <function_name> "(" <arguments> ")]"

<add_op> ::= "+" | "-"

<mul_op> ::= "*" | "/"

<literal> ::= <number> | <string> | <boolean>

<object_name> ::= /[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*/

<condition> ::= <expression> <rel_op> <expression>

<rel_op> ::= "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
```

This grammar covers most of the common features found in programming languages, such as variables, assignments, objects, arrays, functions, conditionals, loops, and expressions. It also includes some specific elements for your hacker game dungeon, such as physical objects, properties, and levels. The `#` symbol is used to indicate a reference to an object or a variable, while the `.` symbol is used to access a property of an object.

Note that this grammar is not complete or perfect, and it may contain some errors or ambiguities. It can be modified or extended according to your needs and preferences. The main purpose of this grammar is to provide a starting point for generating prompts for your hacker game dungeon using the `fold_left` function in OCaml.
