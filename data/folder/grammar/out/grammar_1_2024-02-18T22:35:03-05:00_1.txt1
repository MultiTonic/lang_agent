We are working on creating a GBNF grammar for a game. It follows a standard EBNF notation at the end of this message (see TARGET). We translating an dungeon into this EBNF in chunks. Consider the following chunk of the dungeon between BEGINSRC and ENDSRC for translation to EBNF. BEGINSRC

The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts and functional workflows for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of code in a high tech code based hacking game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon of knowledge generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

The code of the world is written using the languages and grammars generated.
each function or spell of object can be encoded into an emoji string which
is its quasi quine quotation that can be vectorized into a number of tensors.

These tensor can become code and code can become tensors.
we can visualize the tensors in the game using shaders
and mathpylib.
the game is like an augmented reality matrix game where we neo
write our own story.

In this task we want to craft the meta magical folder that will fold
streams of the matrix togehter into one.

Here is the code we wrote so far 
(*

   take inputs :
   grammar : A
   Previous Results : D initially, Initial example : B
   New Example : C
   Created new output D.
   Test D. If good, repeat loop with new D. Othewise feed error back to create new D up to 3 times.
   start with this following code and rewrite it to suit our needs.

let rec fold_left op acc = function
  | []   -> acc
  | h :: t -> fold_left op (op acc h) t
                
 ENDSRC . Please imagine the simulation its execution. Imagine running the code and all the output it would generate. Generate a grammar that we can use to generate prompts for create the hacker game dungeon using your knowledge. Imagine the 8 levels of the world from physical to spirirtual. Write the grammar in EBNF notation. We will start with path through the quasifibers of asts starting at the physcail and going all the way to the spiritual and back. Create a multi-dimensional grammar.

 Result: Here is an example of a multi-dimensional grammar for generating prompts for the hacker game dungeon, written in EBNF notation:

game\_dungeon ::= {level}

level ::= physical | mental | astral | etheric | emotional | mental | spiritual | divine

physical ::=
("You are in a physical level of the dungeon and you see:"
| "You are surrounded by dense, heavy energy as you enter the"
| "As you descend further into the dungeon, you notice the air"
| "The walls of this level of the dungeon are made of rough,"
| "You hear the sound of dripping water echoing through the"
| "You see glints of metal in the distance, could there be"
| "The smell of damp earth fills your nostrils as you explore"
| "You notice a faint humming coming from the walls, it's almost"
| "As you walk, you feel the weight of the earth above you,"
| "You see rays of light streaming in through cracks in the ceiling,")
{object | npc}

mental ::=
("You find yourself in a mental level of the dungeon, where"
| "As you explore this level of the dungeon, you become aware"
| "The air in this level of the dungeon is thin and cold, making"
| "The walls of this level of the dungeon are made of smooth,"
| "You hear whispers and voices all around you, but there's"
| "You see shadows flitting through the corners of your eyes,"
| "A sense of unease settles over you as you explore this"
| "You feel like you're being watched, but you can't see anyone,"
| "As you walk, you start to feel like you're losing your grip"
| "The light in this level of the dungeon is dim and flickering,")
{object | npc}

...

object ::=
("a chest" |
"a pile of gold" |
"a glowing crystal" |
"an ancient tome" |
"a strange device" |
"a rusty key" |
"a mysterious potion" |
"a powerful wand" |
"a magical amulet" |
"a enchanted sword")

npc ::=
("a curious goblin" |
"a wise old sage" |
"a menacing demon" |
"a mischievous fairy" |
"a powerful wizard" |
"a beautiful princess" |
"a fearsome dragon" |
"a lost traveler" |
"a mysterious figure" |
"a ghostly apparition")

This grammar covers eight different levels of the dungeon, each with its own unique atmosphere and set of objects and NPCs. The grammar can be customized and expanded as needed to suit the specific requirements of the game. The function fold\_left is a higher-order function that takes an accumulating parameter `acc` and a binary function `op`, it applies the binary function `op` between the first two elements of the list, then feeds the result as the accumulating parameter to the next iteration, and so on until the end of the list. This allows you to easily apply any function to all elements of a list while maintaining an intermediate state.

 ENDSRC . Please rewrite it to be more beautiful and in EBNF form. We are going to use the following TARGET: BEGINTARGET comment ::= "#" [a-zA-Z0-9 \t]*

S ::= ( " " | "\n" | "\t" | "\r"  )

identifier ::= letter ( letter | digit | "_" )*
terminal ::= "'" character  "'"  ( character  "'" )  "'"

rhs ::= alternation
lhs ::= identifier
rule ::= lhs   S   "="   S   rhs   S   terminator comment*
root ::= comment* ( S   rule   S ) * ENDTARGET as our target grammar format. Please rewrite SRC into TARGET. You are to only respond using the target custom GBNF grammar and put  descriptions or comments at the end of the rule with a #, see the grammar for rules. Please start with a comment using '#' to start comments on a new line.
