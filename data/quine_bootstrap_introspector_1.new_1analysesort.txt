 Result: In variant number 1, I will analyze a consecutive series of sorts to describe the universe and the universe of universes (multiverse) using the following ordering:

1. The Physical Universe: This includes all known matter, energy, space, and time within our observable universe. It can be further divided into subcategories like galaxies, stars, planets, and other celestial bodies.
2. The Multiverse: This concept describes a collection of universes, including our own physical universe. The multiverse could contain an infinite number of universes with various properties, such as different dimensions, laws of physics, or even completely alien structures and civilizations.
3. Conscious Observers: Sorts within this category include intelligent beings capable of observing, understanding, and interacting with the universe(s). These observers could be biological (e.g., humans) or artificial (e.g., AI), existing within our physical universe or in other universes within the multiverse.
4. Mathematical Structures: This sort includes abstract structures like sets, groups, rings, and fields that help us understand and describe properties of the physical universe and the multiverse. These structures can be used to model various phenomena and relationships in physics, topology, geometry, and other scientific domains.
5. Information and Computation: This sort deals with abstract concepts related to information processing, such as algorithms, computational models, data structures, and information theory. These concepts provide a theoretical framework for understanding the limits and capabilities of knowledge acquisition and representation within the universe(s).
6. Meta-theoretic Structures: These are highest-level abstractions that encompass the other sorts listed here. They help us understand how various systems of knowledge, logic, or mathematics relate to one another and provide a foundation for exploring the fundamental principles governing the organization of information within the universe(s).
7. Ultimate Reality or Fundamental Truth: This sort represents the ultimate nature of reality, which may be beyond human comprehension. It could include concepts like string theory, quantum mechanics, or other theories that attempt to explain the most basic building blocks and forces of the universe(s).

Using this ordering, we can analyze the universe and the multiverse by examining their physical properties, observing intelligent life forms, applying mathematical structures, processing information, considering meta-theoretic frameworks, and ultimately striving to understand the ultimate reality or fundamental truth that underlies all existence.
