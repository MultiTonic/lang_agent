 Result: The task you have given can be interpreted in several ways, but I will assume that you want me to provide an ordering of types that describes a universe and a universe of universes, using the language and tools you have mentioned. Here is one possible interpretation:

1. OCaml type for the universe:
```ocaml
type universe = Type.t list
```
This type represents a universe as a list of OCaml types.

2. Coq type for the universe:
```coq
Inductive Universe : Type :=
| U_nat  : Universe
| U_Prop : Universe
| U_Set  : Universe
| U_Type : Universe
| U_prod : Universe -> Universe -> Universe
| U_sum  : Universe -> Universe -> Universe
| U_lam  : (Universe -> Universe) -> Universe.
```
This is the Coq encoding of a universe as a inductive type with constructors for each universe level, including the basic universes `nat`, `Prop`, `Set`, and `Type`, as well as constructors for dependent products, sums, and lambdas.

3. MetaCoq introspection:
```coq
Ltac get_univ_constr := match type of evar in current_goal with
  | @Universe _ => let H := fresh "H" in constr:(H := evar in current_goal)
  | _ => fail "Not a Universe constructor"
end.

Ltac print_univ := match type of evar in current_goal with
  | @Universe _ => let H := evar in current_goal in simpl in (print_term H).
end.
```
These Ltac commands define tactics for introspecting and printing the constructors of a `Universe` value in Coq. The `get_univ_constr` tactic matches on the type of the current goal and binds an evar to the `Universe` constructor if one is present. The `print_univ` tactic prints the term associated with the `Universe` constructor in the current goal.

4. Bootstrapping:

To bootstrap this system, we would first define a simple OCaml program that generates a list of OCaml types representing a universe, such as:
```ocaml
let ocaml_universe = [Type.int; Type.string; Type.unit]
```
We could then translate this universe into Coq using the `coqtop` command-line tool with the following script:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

ocaml_universe="[Type.Int; Type.String; Type.Unit]"

echo "Lemma ocaml_to_coq : Universe := U_prod (U_sum U_nat U_Prop) $ocaml_universe." | coqtop -load Universes.v -interact
```
This script defines a Coq lemma `ocaml_to_coq` that constructs the universe from the OCaml types using the `U_prod`, `U_sum`, and `U_nat` constructors, and then loads the `Universes.v` file to use the previously defined `Universe` type in Coq.

5. Observing:

To observe the universe in Coq, we could define a simple Ltac command that prints the current goal as a `Universe` term using the `print_univ` tactic defined above. For example, if we have already loaded the `Universes.v` file and set up the `get_univ_constr` and `print_univ` tactics, we could define:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

cat > print_current_goal.v <<EOF
Lemma print_current_goal : unit. intros. print_univ. Qed.
EOF
coqtop -load Universes.v -load print_current_goal.v -interact
```
This script defines a new Coq lemma `print_current_goal` that prints the current goal as a `Universe` term using the `print_univ` tactic defined above. We can then load this file and call the `print_current_goal` command to print the current goal as a `Universe` term.

Note that this is just one possible interpretation of your request, and there are many other ways to approach this task using OCaml, Coq, MetaCoq, and introspection.
