 Result: To answer your question, I will provide a consecutive series of sorts to describe the universe and the universe of universes (multiverse) using Variant Number 2.

1. **Physical Universes**: The first sort includes all physically existing universes, including our own observable universe. These universes can be described by their fundamental properties such as spatial dimensions, constituent particles, and interactions between those particles.

2. **Conceptual Universes**: This sort encompasses all conceptual or theoretical frameworks used to understand and describe the physical universe(s). Examples include mathematical models, scientific theories, and philosophical systems.

3. **Simulated Universes**: These are universes that exist as simulations within other universes. They can be created intentionally, such as in a computer simulation, or unintentionally, such as a false vacuum bubble within a larger universe.

4. **Multiverses**: This sort includes all collections of universes, including those that contain physical, conceptual, and simulated universes. Examples include the inflationary multiverse, where each bubble universe has different fields and interactions; or the string theory landscape, where there are many possible configurations of compactified dimensions.

5. **Abstract Universes**: These are the most general sort of universes, encompassing all possible sets of objects and relationships. They may include physical, conceptual, simulated, and multiversal universes as subsets, but they also include more abstract entities such as mathematical structures or logical systems.

6. **Fictional Universes**: Finally, this sort includes all universes that are the product of human imagination, such as those found in literature, film, or games. These universes may be based on real-world physics or entirely fantastical, and they can provide a rich source of inspiration for thinking about the nature of reality itself.
