 Result: For variant number 1, here's one possible ordering to describe the universe and universe of universes (also known as the multiverse):

1. The concept of a universe: This includes defining what is meant by a universe, such as a self-contained system that contains all matter, energy, space, and time within its boundaries.
2. The observable universe: This refers to the part of the universe that we can directly observe and measure, which is currently estimated to be around 93 billion light years in diameter.
3. The history of the universe: This includes discussing the Big Bang theory, the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets, as well as the evolution of life on Earth.
4. The laws of physics that govern the universe: This includes discussions of gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear forces, and quantum mechanics.
5. The concept of a multiverse: This refers to the idea that there may be many universes beyond our own, each with its own set of matter, energy, space, and time.
6. Different theories about the multiverse: There are currently several different theories about how the multiverse might work, including eternal inflation, brane cosmology, and the holographic principle.
7. The implications of a multiverse for our understanding of reality: This includes discussions of the possibility that our universe is just one of many, and what that might mean for our place in the cosmos.
8. The limitations of our current knowledge: Despite our best efforts, there are still many things about the universe (and the multiverse) that we don't understand, and may never be able to fully comprehend.
