 Result: Variant 1:

1. The Physical Universe: This is the observable universe that we exist in, consisting of galaxies, stars, planets, and all known forms of matter and energy.
2. The Multiverse: This concept describes a collection of multiple universes, including our own physical universe. Each universe within the multiverse may have different physical laws and properties.
3. The Omniverse: This is a hypothetical construct that encompasses all possible universes, including both physical and non-physical realities. It includes everything that exists, has ever existed, or will ever exist, in any form or dimension.
4. Consciousness or Mind: Some theories propose that consciousness or mind may be a fundamental aspect of the universe, existing independently of physical matter. This level could describe a universal consciousness or an infinite number of individual consciousnesses.
5. The Absolute or Ultimate Reality: This is the ultimate reality that underlies all existence, whether physical or non-physical. It is beyond space, time, and causation, and may be unknowable or ineffable. This level could describe the ultimate nature of reality, such as a singularity, void, or infinite potentiality.

This ordering describes a progressive expansion from the observable universe to increasingly abstract and all-encompassing concepts. It moves from the physical to the metaphysical, from the concrete to the abstract, and from the particular to the universal.
