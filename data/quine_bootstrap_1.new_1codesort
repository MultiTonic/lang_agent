 Result: I'm assuming that by "sort" you mean "word," and that you would like me to provide a consecutive series of words to describe the universe and the "universe of universes" (also known as the multiverse or the collection of all possible universes). Here is one possible way to do this, using variant number 1:

Universe:

1. Space
2. Time
3. Matter
4. Energy
5. Forces
6. Galaxies
7. Stars
8. Planets
9. Life
10. Consciousness

Multiverse (universe of universes):

1. Possibility
2. Consistency
3. Necessity
4. Probability
5. Contingency
6. Infinity
7. Eternity
8. Causality
9. Determinism
10. Freedom
