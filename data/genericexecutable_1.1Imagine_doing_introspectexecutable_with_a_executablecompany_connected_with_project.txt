We are building a software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Imagine doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: company connected with project . What is your response? Please generate variant array of size 1
#+end_src
#+begin_src output mixtral
 Result: Variant Array of Size 1:

type executable =Executable of string

Let'Imagine = Executable "imagination.exe"

(* Adaptive Language Agent Architecture *)
let language_agent =
match Imagine with
| Executable exe ->
Printf.printf "Running introspection with the executable %s\n" exe;
let result = Proof_Engine.run exe in
Printf.printf "Introspection complete, processing results...\n";
result

(* Building Software Generator *)
let software_generator =
Language_Agent.language_agent :: Proof_Engine.proof_engine :: Large_Language_Model.model :: []

(* Company Project Connection *)
let company_project =
match software_generator with

Printf.printf "Software generator for OCaml with Coq proofs connected to company project.\n"
