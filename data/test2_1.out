 Result: 

To answer this question, let me propose a possible ordering or hierarchy of types that can be used to describe the universe and the universe of universes:

1. Point: A mathematical abstraction representing a location in space or time.
2. Line: A collection of points arranged in a linear order.
3. Plane: A collection of lines arranged in two dimensions.
4. Solid: A collection of planes arranged in three dimensions, forming a bounded region of space.
5. Universe: A collection of solids arranged in four or more dimensions, representing the physical universe we inhabit.
