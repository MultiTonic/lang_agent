 Result: In variant 2, the consecutive series of types used to describe the universe and universe of universes can be ordered as follows:
1. Physical Universe: This includes all matter, energy, space, and time that make up our observable universe. It encompasses everything from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies, as well as all the physical laws that govern their behavior.
2. Multiverse: The multiverse is a hypothetical collection of multiple universes, including our own physical universe. Each universe in the multiverse may have its own set of matter, energy, space, and time, and may be governed by different physical laws.
3. Conscious Universes: This type includes all conscious beings, such as humans, animals, and potentially advanced artificial intelligence. These universes are characterized by subjective experiences, thoughts, emotions, and consciousness.
4. Mathematical Universes: This type of universe includes all mathematical structures and concepts, which some philosophers argue exist independently of human minds. Mathematical universes may be used to describe and predict the behavior of physical and conscious universes.
5. Possible Worlds: This type of universe includes all logically possible worlds, including those that are not physically or mathematically realizable. It is often used in philosophical discussions about modality, possibility, and necessity.
6. Ultimate Ensemble: The ultimate ensemble is a hypothetical collection of all universes, including physical, multiverse, conscious, mathematical, and possible worlds. It is the broadest type of universe, encompassing everything that exists or could exist in any form.

The ordering of these types of universes reflects their level of abstraction, with the physical universe being the most concrete and observable, and the ultimate ensemble being the most abstract and theoretical.
