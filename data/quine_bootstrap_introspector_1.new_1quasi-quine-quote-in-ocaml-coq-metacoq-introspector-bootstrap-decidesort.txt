 Result: The task seems to be asking for a way to define a series of universes and universe of universes using Coq, OCaml, and the MetaCoq introspection library. I will provide an example of how this can be done using inductive types and the Gallina language of Coq.

First, let's define the sort `Universe` which represents a single universe:
```coq
Inductive Universe : Type :=
| U_0
| U_1
| U_2
| ...
| U_n.
```
Next, we can define the sort `UUniverse` which represents a universe of universes:
```coq
Inductive UUniverse : Type :=
| UU_0 : UUniverse
| UU_1 : Universe -> UUniverse
| UU_2 : UUniverse -> UUniverse.
```
In this definition, `UU_0` represents the empty universe of universes, `UU_1` takes a single universe and forms a new universe of universes containing only that universe, and `UU_2` takes a universe of universes and forms a new universe of universes by adding an additional universe to it.

So in this ordering, we have:

* The sort `Universe` representing a single universe.
* The sort `UUniverse` representing a universe of universes, with the following sub-sorts:
	+ `UU_0`, which represents the empty universe of universes.
	+ `UU_1 universe`, which represents a universe of universes containing only the universe `universe`.
	+ `UU_2 (UUniverse)`, which represents a universe of universes formed by adding an additional universe to the universe of universes `UUniverse`.
