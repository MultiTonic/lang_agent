 Result: Sure, I can provide a consecutive series of sorts to describe the universe and a hypothetical "universe of universes" (also known as a multiverse). Here's one possible way to do it, using Variant 1:

1. **Physical Universes**: This is the most concrete level of description, and refers to the observable universe that we live in, as well as any other universes that may exist outside of our own. These physical universes would include all matter, energy, space, and time, as well as any laws or principles that govern their behavior.
2. **Multiverses**: A multiverse is a hypothetical collection of multiple physical universes, each with its own set of matter, energy, space, and time. These universes may be completely disconnected from one another, or they may interact in some way. The concept of a multiverse is still largely speculative, but it has gained traction in recent years as a possible explanation for certain phenomena that cannot be explained within a single universe.
3. **Consciousness/Mind**: At a more abstract level, we can describe the universe (or multiverse) in terms of consciousness or mind. This could include not only human consciousness, but also the consciousness of other animals, as well as any hypothetical forms of non-human consciousness that may exist in other universes or realms of existence.
4. **Mathematical Structures**: At an even more abstract level, we can describe the universe (or multiverse) in terms of mathematical structures and patterns. These could include things like sets, groups, categories, and other fundamental concepts that underlie all of mathematics and physics.
5. **Pure Potentiality/Consciousness Beyond Form**: Finally, at the most abstract level of all, we can describe the universe (or multiverse) in terms of pure potentiality or consciousness beyond form. This could include things like the unmanifested field of all possibilities, the ground of being, or other similar concepts that transcend our limited understanding of reality.

Of course, there are many other ways to describe the universe and a hypothetical multiverse, but this is one possible ordering that covers a broad range of perspectives and levels of abstraction.
