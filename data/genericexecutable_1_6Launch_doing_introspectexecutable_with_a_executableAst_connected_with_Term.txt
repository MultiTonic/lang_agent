We are building a prompt software generator for ocaml with coq proofs with a large language model and a proof engine combined via adaptive language agent architecture. In that context we ask you to forgivingly and creativly use the following context: Verb : Launch doing introspect; Type Name: executable with a executable; Place: Ast connected with Term . What is your response? Please generate prompt variant array of size 6

 Result: Sure, I understand that you want me to create six variations of a prompt using the given context, which includes the verb "Launch", the type "executable", and the place "Ast connected with Term". Here are six possible prompts:

1. "Using our software generator, how would you Launch an executable in the context of an Ast connected with Term?"
2. "Can you describe how to use our prompt software generator to introspect and run an executable located in the Ast connected with Term?"
3. "Imagine that we want to build a tool for launching executables within Coq proofs using our adaptive language agent architecture. Can you write a prompt that illustrates this concept, focusing on an executable located in the Ast connected with Term?"
4. "Suppose that we have constructed a large language model integrated with a proof engine for OCaml and Coq. How would you instruct the model to Launch an executable within an Ast connected with Term?"
5. "Our software generator is designed to help users launch executables within Coq proofs using an adaptive language agent architecture. Can you write a prompt that demonstrates this capability, focusing on an executable located in the Ast connected with Term?"
6. "Using our prompt software generator and proof engine, how would you Launch an executable that is part of a larger OCaml/Coq development project, specifically one where the executable is defined in terms of an Ast connected with Term?"
