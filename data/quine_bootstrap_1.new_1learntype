 Result: Variant number 1:

1. Definition: The universe is typically defined as all existing matter and space considered as a whole; the cosmos. The universe includes all of the galaxies, stars, planets, and all other forms of matter and energy.
2. Size: The size of the universe is difficult to determine due to its constant expansion, but it is estimated to be at least 93 billion light years in diameter.
3. Age: The universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old.
4. Composition: The universe is composed of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy. Ordinary matter makes up only about 5% of the universe, while dark matter and dark energy make up the remaining 95%.
5. Expansion: The universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, which occurred approximately 13.8 billion years ago.
6. Multiverse theory: Some theories propose the existence of a "multiverse," or a collection of multiple universes, each with its own set of matter, energy, and space-time. However, this concept remains purely theoretical and has not been proven by scientific evidence.
7. Inflation theory: The inflation theory proposes that the universe underwent a rapid period of expansion in the first tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang. This expansion was driven by a negative-pressure vacuum energy density, or "inflaton field."
8. String theory: String theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory predicts the existence of multiple dimensions, and suggests that our universe may be just one of many in a "multiverse" of universes.
9. Quantum mechanics: Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with phenomena on a very small scale, such as atoms and subatomic particles. It is a fundamental theory in physics, and has been verified by numerous experiments.
10. General relativity: General relativity is a theory of gravity that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational effect between masses results from their warping of space-time.
