echo "The goal is to create a flexible and customizable system for generating prompts for a language model that can be used to generate creative and imaginative descriptions of a dungeon in a fantasy role-playing game.
the game would involve exploring a dungeon generated using a large language model and a proof engine. The player would navigate through the dungeon, encountering various objects and NPCs along the way, each with their own set of properties and behaviors defined by the terms used in the script.

the game would involve exploring a dungeon and encountering various types of monsters, treasures, and challenges. The player would use weapons, spells, and artifacts to defeat the monsters and complete quests, all while navigating a labyrinthine cave or other underground environment. The game might also include elements of drama, music, and art, as well as secrets and occult themes.

Overall, it seems that the code is designed to generate a richly detailed and immersive fantasy RPG experience using a combination of natural language processing and formal methods. By using a large language model and a proof engine, the game could potentially offer a high degree of realism and interactivity, allowing players to explore and interact with the dungeon in flexible and unpredictable ways.
