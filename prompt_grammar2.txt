symbol ::= "[" | "]" | "{" | "}" | "(" | ")" | "<" | ">"  | "'" |  "=" | "|" | "." | "," | ";" | "-"        | "+" | "*" | "?" 
character ::= letter | digit | symbol | "_" | " "
identifier ::= letter ( letter | digit | "_" )*
S ::= ( " " | "\n" | "\t" | "\r"  )
terminal ::= "'" character  "'"  ( character  "'" )  "'"
terminator ::= (";" | ".")
term ::= "("   S   rhs   S   ")"      | "["   S   rhs   S   "]"      | "{"   S   rhs   S   "}"       ENDTARGET as our target grammar format. Please rewrite SRC into TARGET.
